 Hi, this is Charles Hoskinson broadcasting live from rough and rugged Wyoming. Always rough, always rugged, sometimes Wyoming. It is December 26th, the day after Christmas. I hope everybody had a wonderful Christmas and we're getting ready for the end of the year. I'm enjoying a lovely time up here in Gillette, Wyoming and having a chance to take a look at my construction company, the clinic and all the other amazing things that are going on. Honestly speaking, they're hauling ass and they're doing amazing stuff. It's been the privilege of a lifetime to watch a dream where you kind of start with something like a clinic and you say, hey, let's go build something like that. And then over a period of three years, it goes from just a hypothesis of like maybe kind of sorta to having over 10,000 square feet, 11,000 patients. And we're building an additional 60,000 square feet. It's pretty crazy when you really think about it, you see all those things moving along. And July 4th is going to be a really good and fun time because actually that's when the expansion will be done. All the service lines will be operational. There's going to linger and be an additional four to five months of construction for the biotechnology building, which will be an additional 20,000 square feet. It's currently where the UPS building is. We bought that. We had to buy a lot of land and do a lot of these things. And the area we built the clinic was really not designed for this. So the amount of dirt work we had to do and water mitigation and grading and other things is pretty crazy. Pretty crazy. I'm pretty proud of it. 11,000 patients, I think we'll be up to about 15,000 patients. And we should definitely be able to turn on all those other service lines that we have. It's a multi-specialty practice, internal medicine and cardiology and nephrology, soon to be neurology, got the dermatology, all these types of things. We acquired, I think, more than 20 acres so far. And we may acquire a little bit more land for future growth and expansion. But it's been pretty special. I was actually watching it all come together. And actually it's been a hell of a year, hasn't it? We're dealing with so much going on. Governance is here. It's messy. And a lot of people are learning how to handle it. Lots of people are getting excited about serving as a D-Rep. A lot of people are trying to figure out what it means, Cardano governance. It's the first time in a long time, a lot of people in the industry are starting to pay attention to Cardano again and say, hey, I thought you guys were dead. Oh, my. You're still around. Oh, OK. What's this governance thing about? What's this on-chain update about? Is it like Polkadot? And so obviously we have a long road to go and we have a lot to do.
 嗨，我是查尔斯·霍斯金森，正在怀俄明州粗犷而崎岖的土地上直播。这里总是粗犷，总是崎岖，有时是怀俄明。今天是12月26日，圣诞节后的第一天。希望大家度过了一个美好的圣诞节，我们正为年末做准备。我在怀俄明的吉列享受着美好时光，有机会参观我的建筑公司、诊所以及其他令人惊叹的项目进展。说实话，他们干得热火朝天，成果斐然。

能见证一个梦想从无到有——比如最初只是设想建个诊所——然后三年间发展成超过10,000平方英尺、服务11,000名患者的规模；现在又在扩建60,000平方英尺的空间——这一切想想都让人难以置信。7月4日将是个值得庆祝的日子，因为那时扩建工程将完工所有服务线都将投入运营。生物技术大楼还需四到五个月的施工时间增加20,000平方英尺的面积它目前位于UPS大楼的位置我们买下了那块地不得不购置大量土地并完成诸多工作而我们建造诊所的区域原本并未规划为此所以进行的土方工程、水资源管理及地形平整等工作量之大令人咋舌确实疯狂但我为此感到自豪预计患者数量将从11,000增至15,000人我们将能够全面启动其他服务线这是一个多专科实践涵盖内科心脏病学肾脏病学即将加入神经科还有皮肤科等我们已经收购了超过20英亩土地未来可能还会为了增长和扩展再购入一些这片土地上的一切逐渐成形过去的一年真是波澜壮阔不是吗？我们应对了许多挑战治理机制已上线虽然过程混乱许多人正在学习如何驾驭很多人对担任D-Rep充满热情许多人在探索Cardano治理的意义这是很长一段时间以来行业内的许多人再次关注Cardano说“我以为你们已经销声匿迹了呢哦天哪你们还在啊好吧这个治理是怎么回事链上更新又是什么跟Polkadot类似吗？”显然我们还有很长的路要走还有很多事情要做
 
 


  But I'm pretty proud of the fact that a lot of people stepped up and they're getting it done. You know, you can't always get what you want. But you know, what's nice is everybody's honest. You know, for a long time there were a lot of people who had pent up grievances, myself included. And you know what? Now we all get to be honest. It's no dishonesty to say that there were certainly some disgruntled people that didn't really like IOG that left and joined the foundation. And they kind of silently went about their job. But now they can go to Twitter and tell Twitter what they really feel. And they get to basically blame every problem in the entire world on me or somebody else. And also I get to finally say things that for the last three years have deeply bothered me. And that's the nature of governance. You know, and people in the ecosystem, they can take it as they will. Some people are excited for the drama. Some people hate the drama. Some people think, well, you know, we should just move forward and find some productive compromise. And the good news is with on-chain governance, everything can be kind of sorted out, figured out. You know, people are going to come together. I posted a video not too long ago on my Twitter feed of a bunch of ants solving a problem. And it just blows people's minds when they see that. You know, it's just these little creatures that individually are not very smart. But when they work as a collective whole, they can solve complex problems on a huge scale. And the only reason why they don't rule around the planet is because they're very small. But they're certainly trying. There's a lot more insects than there are people. And when you think about the nature of swarm intelligence, when all the people come together in the cardinal ecosystem and they start solving problems together and coming up with clever ideas, our best days are definitely ahead of us. And it gets me very, very excited. So you know, it's nice to see. And it was a dream 10 years ago. I don't think people fully understand how small and weak and fledgling. You know, there was a time that if I was just hit by a bus or something happened, I don't think we would have gotten where we're at. And now that we're here, there's a lot of people running around saying we need to get rid of Charles. It's amazing, that transformation. It really is when you think about it. And it's hard as a founder when you watch these things grow and change, make a lot of friends along the way. And you always have to figure out what's your role and place and purpose. I have a strong distaste for dishonesty. And I have a strong distaste for duplicity. Nothing pisses me off more than when people lie to my face. Nothing pisses me off more when people manipulate people and use half truths to try to get people to do what they want or convince them that something is the way it is when it's not. And you see that. And it comes out at times. And it's a rage. Because at the end of the day, the purpose of these things is to hurt people that I love and things that I love. And an ecosystem that's been the center point of my life for 10 years. And it's hard because sometimes you just have to let people have their own fights and you have to let them grow up. It's like being a parent. You watch your kids get into things they probably shouldn't. And you say, you know, they've gotten to the age where they're just going to have to figure this out. So we're starting to get to that. But I do believe the on-chain government will get where it needs to go. And I do believe that our best days are ahead of us. So let's get to your questions. Best whiskey, the cheapest best drinking whiskey around, mainly in Japan, is called Hibiki Harmony. It's about 100 bucks a bottle. I say cheap because whiskey can get up to like 10 grand. Bull cycle. Yes, sir. 2025 is going to be crazy. We're just getting started. What style of games your brother building for NES or Super Nintendo want to know so I can start designing some stuff for chips? That's going to be up to the sponsoring content. So the company's name is HOSC Brew. And it's going to be a great place to start. And I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff.
  但我非常自豪的是，很多人挺身而出，正在完成任务。你知道，你不可能总是得到你想要的。但你知道，美好的是每个人都很诚实。很长一段时间以来，包括我在内的很多人都积压了很多不满。你知道吗？现在我们都可以诚实地表达出来。说确实有一些心怀不满的人不喜欢IOG而离开并加入了基金会并不是不诚实的表现。他们默默地完成了自己的工作。但现在他们可以在Twitter上告诉Twitter他们的真实感受了。而且他们基本上可以把世界上所有的问题都归咎于我或其他人身上。我也终于可以说出过去三年里一直深深困扰我的事情了。这就是治理的本质所在吧！生态系统中的成员们会以自己的方式接受它：有人对这场戏剧性变化感到兴奋；有人则厌恶这种纷争；还有人认为我们应该向前看并找到一些富有成效的妥协方案……好消息是通过链上治理机制（on-chain governance），一切都能被梳理清楚、找出解决办法——人们终将团结一致！不久前我在自己的推特时间线上发布了一段视频展示了一群蚂蚁如何解决问题——当大家看到这一幕时都会惊叹不已！这些小生物个体并不聪明但当它们作为一个整体协作时却能够大规模地解决复杂问题 —— 唯一阻止它们统治地球的原因就是体型太小啦～不过显然它们在努力尝试呢毕竟昆虫数量远超人类嘛～想想群体智能（swarm intelligence）本质吧当所有人在Cardano生态系统中聚集起来开始共同解决问题并提出巧妙想法时我们最好的日子肯定还在后头呢这让我感到非常非常激动所以能看到这一切真是太好了这也是十年前的一个梦想我觉得人们并没有完全理解当时我们是多么弱小稚嫩曾经有段时间如果我被公交车撞了或者发生其他意外情况我想我们就不会走到今天这一步而现在我们已经到达这里有很多人四处奔走说我们需要摆脱Charles这种转变真是令人惊叹当你仔细思考时会发现确实如此作为一名创始人看着这些东西成长变化一路上结交了许多朋友同时还要不断弄清楚自己角色定位和目的所在这是很艰难的事情我非常讨厌虚伪与欺骗没有什么比当面撒谎更让我恼火的了也没有什么东西比操纵他人利用半真半假信息试图让别人按照自己意愿行事或说服别人相信某件事并非如此更令我愤怒的了你会看到这种情况时有发生那是一种狂怒因为归根结底这些行为目的是伤害我所爱之人以及我热爱之物还有一个已经成为我生活中心长达十年之久的生态系统这很难受因为有时候你必须让人们自己去战斗让他们成长就像做父母一样看着孩子们陷入可能不该涉足的事物中你说他们已经到了必须靠自己解决问题的年纪所以我们正开始走向那个阶段但我相信链上政府会达到它需要去的地方我也坚信我们最美好的日子在前方等着我们那么让我们来回答你的问题吧最好威士忌日本附近最便宜又好喝主要叫响(Hibiki Harmony)每瓶大约100美元我说便宜是因为威士忌价格可以高达上万牛市周期没错先生2025年将会疯狂我们现在才刚刚起步你兄弟为NES还是超级任天堂打造游戏风格想知道这样我可以开始设计一些芯片相关内容这将取决于赞助内容公司名字叫HOSC Brew这将是一个很好的起点我会做很多事情
  

   So I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff. And I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff. Sponsoring content. So the company's name is HOSC Brew. And we have a lot of plans and we'll make a dedicated video about it, a lot of marketing about it. But if you're interested, just talk to JJ and we'll get you on the list and we can figure it out. We can do CRPGs. We can do standard adventure games. We can do FPSs. There's a lot of options that are there. Does anyone keep you in check every single day? You know, it's kind of funny. When you're in my position, you can't make a mistake and you can't even be perceived to make a mistake. I'll give you a great example of that. So the other day, I saw a bot on Twitter and the bot had very lifelike behavior. I was kind of curious about it. I said, what are the limits of this type of bot? So it's criticizing Cardano. It's criticizing Cardano. So I try to catch the bot in a loop and I say, all right, well, what are your grievances? And then it goes off and goes to its pre-canned, pre-programmed stuff. And then I follow up with another question, trying to drill in. And I'm really trying to play with this bot because I want to understand at what point does it lose its depth? And then a community member stepped in and then I said, hey, guys, I know it's a bot. I'm playing with it. I'm trying to figure this out. Well, the whole conversation is about this bot. I'm playing with it. I'm trying to figure this out. Well, the whole conversation was clipped up and only a part of it was spread around, made it look like I didn't know it was a bot and I didn't care. And I'm just incompetent and whatever. Front page of cryptocurrency read it. And then one of the tweets had over a million impressions, tens of thousands of retweets about it and obviously just a personal attack. And it's amazing because when we had our signing of the Constitution of Cardano, the most significant event in the history of Cardano was not on the front page of cryptocurrency read it. But a thread making me look bad was. And, you know, it's like, guys, Lars Brunius has been working for two years on the Me Box idea. I invited Rudy Rucker, the inventor of the Life Box concept, to my summit in 2019 in Miami. And he spoke there with Stephen Wolfram about the Life Box and these other things. So you'd think maybe just maybe that we're kind of curious about what bots can do reflect one of the companies we had in the portfolio was doing digital twins for over a year. We're quite interested in this. And we've been discussing internally this idea of creating digital twins of ourselves for various different utilities, either to analyze things or to interact with people or help people. So maybe just maybe when you see a bot, you're always curious where did that come from and what capabilities it has. Like, for example, I've been thinking in 2025 to create a Twitter bot version of myself to run my Twitter feed. So I don't actually have to manage it because it's becoming diminishing returns. But apparently we don't know any of that because, you know, the Internet's not built for that. It's built for controversy. So who keeps me in check? Pretty much everybody every day, even for things we don't do. How long till you're back at WolfMog? It irritates me. You know, it's pointless to pick fights with people. When we get into a fight about $600 million of the community's money and the future of the community's governance and who is accountable to whom, I think that's a conversation we're having. But apparently that's not WolfMog. So what is that? Just never get in a fight? Never ever stand up for anything? Never fight for anything? Just be fun and happy to every single person and agreeable to every person, even people that you feel are stealing from you or are causing harm to the ecosystem, causing harm to others? So is WolfMog being on the subway train that Guatemalan guy walks over and dowses so many gasoline sets them on fire and doing nothing? Because that would be a fight and being disagreeable. Oh, no, but that no, we should. And how do we do that? What's the test? My test is pretty simple. When something affects everyone, and in my view, Pretty WolfMog to me. Charles, not sure if you remember. Is this real life? Not AI or anything? Well, I can't tell the difference. Doesn't matter. Please talk about chain link. What are the techies talking about? In 2021, We talked about integration. They agreed to do it. And a long time I thought they had integrated. And I think that's a good point. But I think that's a good point. But I think that's a good point. But I think that's a good point. A long time I thought they had integrated on the chain. And then I was told that they hadn't. Where I don't think there's a commercial issue or a disagreement or an integration or technical issue. I think that's just something got cross-wired and an accountable party to do it is no longer around. So we do care about oracles. There's Charlie 3, there's Flair that we just talked to. We're looking about integration there. So chain link is something that we wanted. I know Sergey Nazarov. The chain link ecosystem has always been very friendly to us. So we'll circle back. So we'll circle back. And I'll find out what happened there. Peter asked what you think of the new chain link ecosystem? And I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. Peter asked what's your biggest learning or takeaway from Constitutional Convention? Peter, Sydney, Australia delegate. Well first thank you for your service. The biggest thing probably was the the the the the the the the the the the all of them. I love the courage that they have. And I love the commitment that they have to Cardano. And I know that they're going to get where they need to be. Well a good possibility the Constitution will get passed on chain. But that's just the beginning. We have to improve the governance system to be more inclusive and to be more fair. And so there's a lot more code to write. There's a lot more protocols to explore. But at least we have people to explore. But at least we have people to explore. But at least we have people to explore. But at least we have people to explore. Charles, can we get an AMA with you, David Schwartz, Hugo, Flawn, and Gavin Woods in 2025? Sure. I have no problem with that. That'd be fun. I was laughing because Charles is interacting. Yeah, you're talking about the bot. And you just got the report of the news. And you just got the report of the news. Those types of things. Mine? Says who? You? These people seem to love me. Is it possible to quantum proof crypto? Yes. It's called post-quantum crypto. There's many different approaches like learning with error and isogenies and hash-based crypto. MacWare went with us down to actually the Constitutional Convention. And he was an observer. And Mark's a great guy. And one of these days we'll do a podcast together. That'd be a heck of a lot of fun. Maybe we can do it with Tucker. Any news about Crazy Mary? For those of you who don't know, is a beefalo. It's the only one I have in the ranch. Half buffalo, half cow. Big, mean, and crazy. Do you think the USA did mistakes to leave Afghanistan?
所以我将会做很多事情。我会赞助内容。公司名叫HOSC Brew，我们有很多计划，会专门制作视频进行大量营销。如果你感兴趣，找JJ聊聊，我们会把你列入名单并一起想办法。我们可以做CRPG、标准冒险游戏、FPS等很多类型的项目。

有人每天监督你吗？说起来挺有趣的。在我这个位置上，你不能犯错甚至不能让人觉得你可能犯错。举个例子：前几天我在Twitter上看到一个行为逼真的机器人批评Cardano（卡尔达诺），出于好奇我想试探它的极限在哪里——于是我问它有什么不满之处；接着它就按照预设程序回应了；我又跟进提问试图深入挖掘——其实我只是想看看这种机器人在哪一点上会失去深度而已……结果有位社区成员插话进来时我说：“嘿伙计们我知道这是个机器人啦！我正在研究呢！”整段对话都是关于这个机器人的啊！可后来只截取部分传播开来搞得好像我不知道那是机器人也不在乎似的…还说我无能等等...加密货币头条新闻都报道了这件事儿;其中一条推文获得超过百万次展示及数万转发量显然就是人身攻击嘛~有意思的是当我们签署《卡尔达诺宪法》时(这是Cardano历史上最重要的事件)却没能登上加密货币头条新闻而让我难堪的帖子反而上了...

Lars Brunius已经为Me Box概念工作两年多了;2019年我在迈阿密峰会上邀请了Life Box概念的发明者Rudy Rucker与Stephen Wolfram共同探讨过相关问题...所以你们可能会觉得我们对这类技术很感兴趣吧?毕竟投资组合中有家公司从事数字孪生技术已逾一年之久...我们也一直在内部讨论创建自己数字分身用于分析事物或与人互动帮助他人等各种用途的可能性...因此当你遇到一个bot时总会好奇它是从哪儿来的以及具备哪些能力比如我就在考虑2025年创建一个自己的Twitter bot来管理我的推特账号因为亲自打理越来越不划算了但显然大家并不了解这些情况互联网不是为此设计的而是为了制造争议而生...

那么谁在监督我呢?几乎每个人每天都在这么做即使是我们没做过的事情也会被盯上...

什么时候回WolfMog?这让我很恼火你知道吗跟人吵架毫无意义当我们因6亿美元社区资金和未来治理权责归属问题争执不休时才值得一谈但显然那不算WolfMog所以到底什么才是呢永远不打架永远不为任何事挺身而出永不争取任何事情对每个人都友善快乐顺从哪怕对方正在偷窃你的东西或者损害生态系统伤害他人这样才算吗难道像那个危地马拉男子在地铁车厢里泼汽油点火然后袖手旁观才叫WolfMog因为那样会引起冲突显得不合群哦不不我们应该而且该怎么做测试标准很简单当某件事影响到所有人在我看来就属于Pretty WolfMog范畴Charles不知道你还记不记得这是真实生活还是AI或其他什么玩意儿分不清没关系请谈谈Chain Link技术人员都在讨论些什么2021年我们谈到集成他们同意做了很久以来我以为他们已经完成了链上集成后来被告知并没有我认为不存在商业分歧或技术障碍只是某个环节出了差错负责此事的人已经不在了所以我们确实关心预言机有Charlie 3还有刚聊过的Flair我们在考虑那边的集成Chain Link是我们想要的东西我认识Sergey Nazarov Chain Link生态一直对我们非常友好我们会回头再联系找出问题所在Peter问你对新Chain Link生态有何看法我觉得这是个好问题Peter作为澳大利亚悉尼代表首先感谢您的服务最大的收获可能是所有的一切我爱他们的勇气和对Cardano的承诺我相信他们会达到目标很有可能宪法会在链上通过但这只是开始我们需要改进治理系统使其更具包容性和公平性还有很多代码要写很多协议要探索至少我们有人员去探索Charles能否安排一次AMA邀请David Schwartz Hugo Flawn Gavin Woods参加当然没问题那会很有趣我当时笑了因为Charles正在互动没错你在谈论那个bot刚刚收到新闻报道那些事情我的谁说你说这些人似乎很喜欢我真的可以量子证明加密吗是的这叫后量子密码学有多种方法如基于错误学习同源哈希MacWare和我们一起参加了制宪会议他是观察员Mark是个很棒的人总有一天我们会一起录制播客那将非常有趣也许可以和Tucker合作有任何关于Crazy Mary的消息对于那些不知道的人来说她是一头野牛是我牧场里唯一的一只半水牛半奶牛又大又凶还疯狂你觉得美国撤离阿富汗是否犯了错误



 Big respect for them. Challenge, because when you fight a war, you have to be very clear about what is the mission, why are we fighting the war, what are we prepared to do to win that war, what's the victory condition, what's the exit condition. You know, multi-nation effort with big armies crashing into each other like World War II. There's a legitimate element that we can put back into power. It's just a nation-building exercise where we're going to occupy the place and construct it for a long time. I mean, look at South Korea and Japan. After World War II, the United States was able to take control of Afghanistan alongside US special forces. And for the early days of the conflict, the goal was to find and kill Osama bin Laden and to disrupt the Taliban government and degrade its capabilities. Then it scaled up to a large scale of collapse. But the challenge with Afghanistan is it was never just Afghanistan, it was also Pakistan and to a certain extent other border nations like Iran and Azerbaijan. Is that when you have these border nations, they can harbor terrorist elements or elements of the prior regime. Pakistan is the biggest issue there. And so we're kind of fighting a three-sided war. You need to fight a 360. There should be a Messi to that. Obviously. I think that didn't stop in thatsplitting all of that war. But is there any way to Judges, what are the signals for And then year after year passed, more people died, more money spent, and eventually some president had to be the president who's the donkey, who basically pulls the plug and leaves. In the case of Vietnam, that was Nixon. Disastrous the conflict had been and said, look, you can go another 10 years, but ultimately it's going to end the same way, in defeat. So it's a great case study and don't start things unless you're prepared to finish it. Charles, there's no way you're only 37. I am. This is what crypto does to you. You lose your hair, your beard gets white, belly gets big. Here's what it is. Is my mic still on? Yeah, the mic is still on. It's still on. Okay, there we go. Can you guys hear me now? No, it's on. The mic's on. No sound. No sound. Hello. There we go. It's fixed. Yeah, this is the integrated microphone. I was using my anchor works microphone here and unfortunately it didn't work because this new office I have up here at Gillette doesn't have a microphone set up yet. Yeah, you guys lose me for 20 minutes. Come on. And there's the angry crypto show. Good guy. Haven't heard much about Plutus recently. Yeah, just a lot of stuff under the hood. The Aiken people love to say that they save Cardano smart contracts and they've done all these amazing things and it's kind of true that they've created something that's very usable that people really enjoy and like. And I think now 63, 70% of all Cardano smart contracts, new contracts are being written. But Plutus V3 just launched with CERN knowledge capabilities and a lot of people are utilizing those and there's a litany of other capabilities that are coming online with V4 and a lot of great ideas that have come from the community as a whole. The thing is that UPLC is kind of a place you can pile to and I don't really care if it's high assurance Plutus, Aiken or TypeScript. It's kind of a choose your own adventure. You know, you want it to have a good dev ex for the developer and that developer may come from a functional background. They may come from an object oriented background. They might be a kind of a web developer that's kind of HTML-ish and they don't have a lot of coding skills. And in all those cases, you'd like to have a choose your own adventure and a path for them to get where they need to go. And it's nice that we now have some beginner stuff and intermediate stuff inside the ecosystem that doesn't really require you to be a domain expert in Haskell to do well and develop applications in Cardano. And it's getting easier and easier. Still some issues with logging and issues with concurrency and all these edge cases that are challenging for people. And the goal of each version of Cardano, Plutus, is to kind of open up a large list of capabilities. And then typically at the surface language and library level, we can resolve those types of things. Ten years and this guy is still making excuses. What excuses? That's the internet. That's the internet for you. Oh, you guys. Just once I'd love for the criticism to be somewhat legitimate. It's like, well, you said this thing was going to happen. It didn't happen. Okay, that's fair. But you're making excuses. Like, people write smart contracts in Cardano. They like Cardano. You know, it works really well for lots of different things. And people build cool stuff every day. And if you go to Tap Tools or Dex Hunter or whatever, you can see all the really cool, amazing things that have been built in the Cardano ecosystem and all the cool projects. And you see that they're actually doing real and interesting stuff and they're upgrading all the time. And MnSwap upgraded and SundaySwap upgraded. And people are trying to keep up with all the new capabilities. And it's a very bright community filled with a lot of vibrant and innovative stuff. There's a lot of vibrant, young and passionate people. And that's why we're successful. And that's what keeps Cardano going and pushing Cardano through. And I'm kind of sad that they never get the credit that they deserve. You know, when people criticize, they say Cardano just doesn't exist. Those people don't exist. Nothing exists. Nothing's been done. It's just a wallet. You say, have you ever actually spent a moment and used a Cardano debt? I can't do that. It's not possible. A YouTuber told me it's not possible. Yeah, OK. But let's say you're wrong. Don't you think you're being a bit offensive to people who have spent years of their lives doing things? Well, I don't care because the Internet's no empathy. You know, and it's a curious thing where even when you show them the evidence and you show them the daps and you show them the infrastructure, they still keep saying the same stuff again. Yeah. And I don't know why. Maybe, yeah, there's a trolling element to it. But when you meet these people, some cases they legitimately believe what they're saying. And then you try to figure out, like, where do they get the information from? Who are the purveyors of misinformation that are floating around? And I've always been trying to identify that because I say, all right, we know what we'll do is we'll just go on those shows and kick these guys in the teeth and say, this is what we do. Look how great we are. But unfortunately, we can never really isolate it. Is what it is. Did you lose some weight finally? Yeah, I'm working on it. It's a process. Can you share any new updates regarding your talks with Ripple? I think a lot of the early days, you know, we'd like to include Ripple in the Midnight ecosystem. And there are ongoing talks between the Midnight people and the Ripple people and a lot of technological talks as well. And we've been trying to learn more about how their stack works. There's some cordon-o-tech we invented, in particular Marlowe, that would be tremendously useful with the Ripple ecosystem. And it would be a lot of fun to see what we could do there. And also just some things in Ripple like Flare, for example, are pretty cool, pretty interesting. But, you know, it takes time for these things to foment. And the first step was just technical conversations. And that's what we did with David, who's been tremendously helpful and a great asset. And then at some point, once you've gotten beyond that, then there's actual integration work and other things to get done. But overall, they've been easy to work with. We met also with the real USD people. They just finally got past launch. And they're trying to recover from that because that was an incredibly time-consuming effort. But we're really proud of them. And I do believe they're going to start adding other chains next year. And my recommendation to that was a self-serve model similar to Coinbase's Rosetta. It makes it a lot easier to see who's serious and who's not serious. But it would be fun to bring that into their orbit. There's no reason for us not to work together. Well, guess what? It's MySpace. So not only do I get to ban you, I get also to delete your comments. Goodbye. 
对他们表示极大的敬意。挑战在于，当你参与一场战争时，必须非常明确任务是什么、我们为何而战、为了赢得这场战争我们准备付出什么代价、胜利的条件是什么以及退出的条件又是什么。就像二战那样，多国联合行动，大军激烈交锋。我们可以合法地让某个政权重新掌权。这实际上是一项国家重建工程，我们将长期占领并改造那个地方。看看韩国和日本就知道了。

二战后，美国得以与特种部队一同掌控阿富汗。冲突初期目标是找到并击毙奥萨马·本·拉登，瓦解塔利班政府并削弱其能力。随后规模扩大至大规模崩溃阶段。但阿富汗的挑战在于它从来不只是阿富汗本身的问题，还涉及巴基斯坦及一定程度上如伊朗和阿塞拜疆等邻国问题——这些边境国家可能庇护恐怖分子或前政权的残余势力，其中巴基斯坦是最大的难题。

因此我们在某种程度上是在进行一场三面作战的战争：需要全方位应对（360度），应当有梅西那样的角色来主导这一切显然如此我认为这并未阻止那场战争的割裂局面但是否有任何方法来判断法官们什么是信号呢然后年复一年过去更多人丧生更多资金投入最终总得有一位总统成为那个“驴子”即决定撤军离开的人比如越南战争中就是尼克松他认识到冲突已多么灾难性并表示你们可以再打十年但最终结局仍将是失败所以这是一个很好的案例研究除非你准备好坚持到底否则不要轻易开启查尔斯你不可能只有37岁吧我就是这就是加密货币对你的影响掉头发胡子变白肚子变大就是这样我的麦克风还在开着吗是的麦克风还开着没问题现在能听到我说话了吗不它在开着没有声音没声音喂好了修好了对这是集成麦克风我之前用的是Anchor Works的麦克风可惜新办公室在吉列这里还没设置好麦克风设备嗯你们失去联系20分钟了来吧愤怒的加密节目开始了好人最近关于Plutus的消息不多啊是啊主要是幕后工作Aiken团队喜欢说他们拯救了Cardano智能合约做了许多了不起的事确实他们创造出了人们喜爱且实用的东西现在大约63%到70%的新Cardano智能合约都是用他们的工具编写的

Plutus V3刚刚发布具备CERN知识处理能力很多人正在利用这些功能V4版本还将带来一系列其他功能上线社区整体贡献了许多优秀创意关键在于UPLC是一个你可以堆叠的平台我不太在意它是高保证度的Plutus还是Aiken或TypeScript更像是选择你自己的冒险旅程开发者体验要好无论他们是来自函数式编程背景面向对象背景还是类似HTML风格的网页开发缺乏深厚编码技能在所有情况下都希望能为他们提供一条通往目的地的路径很高兴现在我们生态系统内有一些初级和中级的资源不再要求你必须成为Haskell领域的专家也能在Cardano上良好开发和构建应用变得越来越容易尽管日志记录并发等问题和一些边缘情况仍然存在挑战每个版本的Cardano Plutus目标都是开放大量新功能然后在表层语言和库层面解决这些问题

十年过去了这家伙还在找借口什么借口互联网就这样哦你们这些人真希望批评能有点根据比如说你说过某件事会发生结果没发生好吧那还算公平但你这是在找借口人们在Cardano上编写智能合约他们喜欢Cardano你知道吗它对很多不同的事情运作得很好每天都有酷炫的东西被建造出来如果你去Tap Tools或者Dex Hunter之类的平台就能看到所有在Cardano生态系统中构建的真正酷炫惊人的项目它们不断升级MnSwap升级了SundaySwap也升级了大家都在努力跟上所有新功能这是一个充满活力创新精神的社区有很多年轻热情的人这也是为什么我们能成功推动着卡达诺前进我为它们从未得到应有的认可感到难过当人们批评时说卡达诺根本不存在那些人不存在什么都没做只是个钱包你有没有真正花时间用过一次卡达诺债务？我不能那么做不可能的有个YouTuber告诉我这是不可能的好的假设你是错的你不觉得对那些花费多年生命做事的人来说有点冒犯吗？我不在乎因为互联网上没有同理心即使你展示证据给他们看daps和基础设施他们依然重复同样的话我不知道为什么也许其中有恶搞成分但当遇到这些人时有些情况下他们是真心相信自己的说法然后你会试图弄清楚他们的信息来源是谁散布的这些错误信息我一直想找出源头因为我们知道该怎么做就是上那些节目直接反驳他们说这就是我们所做的看看我们有多棒但遗憾的是我们始终无法彻底隔离这种现象事实如此

你终于减了点体重吗？是的我正在努力这是个过程你能分享一下与Ripple谈判的最新进展吗早期我们希望将Ripple纳入Midnight生态系统Midnight团队与Ripple团队之间持续进行技术交流我们也一直在学习他们的技术栈如何运作特别是我们发明的Marlowe这种cordon-o-tech对于Ripple生态系统会极其有用在那里探索可能性也会很有趣另外像Flare这样的Ripple内部项目也很酷很有意思但这些事情发酵需要时间第一步只是技术对话这是我们和大卫一起做的他提供了巨大帮助是个宝贵的资产一旦超越这个阶段接下来就是实际的整合工作和其他事项总体来说与他们合作很顺利我们还见到了real USD团队他们刚度过启动期正从中恢复过来因为那是极其耗时的工作但我们真的为他们感到骄傲我相信明年他们会开始添加其他链我的建议是采用类似于Coinbase Rosetta的自助服务模式这样更容易看出谁认真谁不认真不过将其引入他们的轨道会很有趣我们没有理由不合作猜怎么着这里是MySpace所以我不仅能封禁你还删除你的评论再见


There we go. There we go. What temperature do you have your cold plunge? Do you air dry off for the shiver benefits? Even if you don't air dry off, I got shit to do. It's about one to two Celsius, about 34 Fahrenheit. Yeah, this is the problem with the proof of work crowd. They just can't accept that there are alternative consensus algorithms. Really can't. Not much you can do, though. It's not an intellectual debate. You can sit down and say, let's have a conversation. Here's all the science. Here's all the code. And then it's you're wrong or right. OK, we'll put that in. Here's all the science. Here's all the code. And then it's you're wrong or right. OK, well, here's all the science. Here's all the code. Oh, no, you're wrong. You're right. Well, we've been running for seven years, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Nope, you're wrong. We're right. OK, that's a religion. That's not a scientific argument. That's OK. I think it's time to go back to the old days and have some giraffe pictures on the wall and some giraffes behind you. I just got to get a stable home. I've been building like crazy in a lot of different areas. And it'd be good to actually get to my home again. I've been living in temporary homes for a while. But it would be, I agree. How do you like Gillette? I love the people of Gillette. Gillette as a town is a little tough. The restaurant selection leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully, we'll be able to improve that. And it gets very cold. And the wind is quite brutal. It can be negative 40 and 100 mile an hour wind. I've seen birds freeze to death in the trees. And I've seen birds die. And I've seen birds die. And I've seen birds die. And I've seen birds freeze to death in the trees. That's cold. So Gillette can be quite challenging. Midnight is a CNT that houses its own blockchain. It's the dual token model. It has two tokens. One that lives on the partner chain and one that lives on Cardano. I've been saying it for two years now. There's a two-token model. So there's a Cardano anchor. And it has a consumption token, a capacity unit that lives on the side chain. That's why it benefits Cardano so much. And actually, because it's a CNT, you have to build all this stuff for CNTs. And you actually get the custodians to support it and the wallets to support it, which has been a tremendous issue. But we're pushing through. It'll cost $20 million-plus. Should have been done years ago. If only there was an entity that was responsible for that. No figure. Is what it is. Is Cardano doomed now that it has a foundation issue? No. Cardano's built in granite. There is no little drama or foundation issue that can cause a problem. Just slow certain things down. It means certain people have to work harder. Or it takes a little longer to get things where they need to be. But we're not doomed. Cardano's, Cardano's. It's always going to be here. And it's kept alive by the passion of the countless thousands who really, really care and fight hard for it. It's just they're adults and they need to be told the truth. And they need to be told what's going on. And you let people make decisions accordingly. I mean, I don't think for a moment it's going to slow anything down. I doubt this guy has ever seen a Cardano developer in person. Of all the people, I'm probably the one who actually has, right? But you bring up an interesting point. It would be nice if the Cardano developers actually went to, and many do, but not an coordinated, organized effort, places like Token 2049 and Consensus. It'd be fun to bring them all there and get them coming. And I think there's a path to make such things happen. It's just for some reason we don't quite as an ecosystem invest in that. And I think that's something that we can correct in 2025. Do you think the drones in New Jersey are really aliens? I mentioned in a Twitter space what I thought the drones were. I thought about it for a while, and I talked to a few people that I know who are close to these types of things. And the first thing is for US airspace. So the United States of America is one of the best guarded places in the world. And if you as a foreign power show up with large drones and enter our airspace, we're going to know about it. And we're going to fly sorties and shoot them down. Look at the balloon that China sent over. People criticized the fact that it took a few days to shoot it down, but the reality is that's just what we do. We're very good at destroying things. Now, if these are private drones invading airspace around airports and facilities that are mission critical, there are capabilities to shoot those down in the local law enforcement. So the fact that they're flying around without any fear means that they're government assets. They belong to the US government. Now, typically when the US government would fly those types of assets at night, they would file a flight plan with the FAA. And the FAA would say, OK, well, what type of test you're doing and what you're doing. Even if it's not a statutory requirement in all cases, they would do so as a courtesy for safety reasons to alert other pilots that there's a restricted airspace. There's going to be a type of aircraft flying in and avoid those areas for these times because there's a chance of collision. Because nobody wants to be in a situation where a military aircraft hits a civilian aircraft and kills somebody. That instantly means court marshals and investigations and all these things. So typically speaking, if it's an exercise or a test of a new capability, there'll be a mechanism upon which the airspace can be closed. And almost certainly, they would not test experimental new things over highly populated civilian areas. They would do so in areas that are low population density like Utah and Nevada and Wyoming, because your probability of an incident is very low. Also, in some cases, you don't really want to do this in a public way. So you fly it over low population density because you tend not to be seen for those types of operations. So that means as a government asset and they're not doing a test, it's a real life scenario. So why would you fly a drone low over densely populated civilian areas that the government asset at night? Well, if you fly during the daytime, you have better visibility. But the sun does interfere with a very specific type of sensor, radiation sensors. So if you're flying low as a drone over a highly populated area during the nighttime with military asset, you're probably looking for a radioactive source and they're flying in patterns that would give them the ability to triangulate. You notice those triangles kind of like GPS where they always have three. So there's a good possibility that what's going on is there's some nuclear source that US drones are looking for in a densely populated area. It could be a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb. And that would also explain why they wouldn't talk about it publicly, because it would incite a panic. If you lived in New York or New Jersey and you heard that the US government is looking for a dirty bomb or a nuclear weapon, it would scare the hell out of you and it would cause a lot of people to evacuate and run for the hills. So, you know, keep it under wraps. So then there's an open question. What could that be? And what I've heard is that in 1994, when Ukraine and Russia reached an agreement for the Ukrainian nuclear stockpile to return to Russia, there were about 1600 nuclear weapons and nuclear like weapons that were returned. But some people say that 40 to 50 were not returned and were actually held on by the Ukrainian government as kind of an insurance policy just in case they got invaded and they were lost in the translation. So then the natural question is if you were to lose some nuclear weapons, where would you hide them? Where would you put them? Well, Chernobyl actually makes an incredibly good case because the background radiation makes it really hard to actually locate any nuclear payload. And you just bury them somewhere in Chernobyl. They're quite hard to find at that point. So here's an interesting thing. In 2022, when Putin invaded Ukraine, he attacked Chernobyl and sent his troops there and they were digging in the exclusion zone, disturbing the highly radioactive soil, which is a pretty absurd thing because the Russians have a pretty good understanding of Chernobyl because they built everything up there and they did all the reclamation. And there's still people alive in Russia who deeply understand the nuclear exclusion zone. And that's a really bad idea to dig. So why did the Russians go to a desolate nuclear excluded zone right after they invaded the country and started digging around looking for something? Well, maybe they believed there were weapons there. And the word on the street is one of them is missing and it got smuggled in. That's what the conspiracy theory people say. But it would line up perfectly with a drone situation where the drones are actually looking for something like that. But the truth is, we don't know. And the problem is bigger than just a missing nuclear weapon and a drone. It's more of a systemic paranoia, apathy and cynicism about the U.S. government. We have a situation where the president-elect is suspicious of the incumbent president and there's zero coordination or discussion about this issue. 

好了，好了。你的冷水浴温度是多少？你会为了颤抖的好处而自然风干吗？即使你不自然风干，我也有事要做。水温大约在1到2摄氏度，约34华氏度。是的，这就是工作量证明派的问题所在。他们就是无法接受还有其他共识算法存在的事实。真的无法接受。不过你也没办法改变什么。这不是一场智力辩论。你可以坐下来谈谈，说我们来聊聊吧，这里有所有的科学依据和代码支持对错分明的事情上——好吧我们把这些放进去看看结果如何……但最终还是会变成“你是错的”“不我是对的”这样无休止的争论。“我们已经连续运行七年了每天24小时每周七天不停歇。”“不你们错了我们才是正确的。”这已经成了一种信仰而非科学的讨论了。

我觉得是时候回到过去那种日子了墙上挂些长颈鹿图片背后再站几只真家伙什么的...我现在急需一个稳定的住所最近在各个领域疯狂建设确实该回自己家待待了我已经在临时住处住了一段时间但我同意你的看法你觉得吉列怎么样?我很喜欢那里的人们至于吉列这个小镇嘛就有点难搞了餐馆选择实在有限希望以后能有所改善而且天气非常寒冷风力也相当猛烈有时能达到零下40度加上每小时100英里的风速我看到过鸟儿在树上冻死看到过它们死去一次又一次那真是冷啊所以生活在吉列还是挺有挑战性的

Midnight是一个拥有自己区块链的CNT它采用双代币模型有两个代币一个存在于合作伙伴链上一个存在于Cardano上我已经说了两年了这个两代币模型所以有一个Cardano锚点还有一个消费代币即侧链上的容量单位这就是为什么它对Cardano如此有利实际上因为它是CNT你必须为CNTs构建所有这些基础设施还得让托管人和钱包支持它这曾经是个大问题但我们正在努力克服预计将花费超过2000万美元本应几年前就完成的如果有个实体负责这事就好了但没有这样的人选事情就是这样现在Cardano有了基金会问题是注定要失败了吗?不会的 Cardano坚如磐石没有什么小插曲或基金会问题能造成真正的影响顶多让某些事情进展慢一点意味着有些人需要更努力工作或者达到目标所需时间稍长一些但我们绝不会完蛋 Cardano永远都会在这里无数真心热爱并为之奋斗的人们的热情让它生生不息只是他们都是成年人需要被告知真相了解现状然后让他们据此做出决定我认为这件事丝毫不会拖慢任何进度我怀疑这家伙从未亲眼见过一位Cardano开发者在所有这些人中可能只有我真的见过对吧但你提出了一个有趣的观点如果Cardano开发者们能够去参加像Token 2049和Consensus这样的活动那就太好了虽然很多人确实会去但不是以协调一致、有组织的方式去的把他们全都带到那里让大家聚在一起我想是有办法实现这种事的只是出于某种原因我们这个生态系统没有在这方面投入太多我认为这是我们在2025年可以纠正的一个方面

你认为新泽西州的无人机真的是外星人吗?我在Twitter空间里提到过我对这些无人机的看法我想了很久也和几个熟悉这类事物的人聊过首先对于美国领空来说美利坚合众国是世界上守卫最严密的地方之一如果你作为一个外国势力带着大型无人机进入我们的领空我们会知道的并且会派出飞机将其击落看看中国放过来的那个气球人们批评说花了几天才把它打下来但现实情况就是我们就是这么做的我们非常擅长摧毁东西那么如果是私人无人机入侵机场周围的关键设施附近的空域当地执法部门有能力将其击落所以它们毫无顾忌地飞来飞去这一事实说明它们是政府资产属于美国政府通常当美国政府要在夜间飞行这类资产时会向FAA提交飞行计划FAA会说好的你们在进行什么类型的测试以及具体做什么即便并非所有情况下都有法定要求他们也会出于安全考虑礼貌性地通知其他飞行员某片空域将被限制会有某种类型的飞机飞入在这些时间段避开那些区域以防发生碰撞因为没人愿意看到军用飞机撞上民用飞机导致人员伤亡那样立刻就会引发军事法庭审判调查等一系列麻烦因此一般来说如果是演习或测试新能力会有相应的机制来关闭相关空域而且几乎可以肯定的是他们不会在人烟稠密的居民区上空试验新的实验性装备他们会选择犹他州内华达州怀俄明州等人口密度低的地区因为在那里发生事故的概率很低此外在某些情况下你并不想公开进行此类行动所以在低人口密度地区飞行就不太容易被发现这意味着作为政府资产且不是在测试那就是真实场景那么为什么要让政府的无人机在夜间低飞于人口密集的居民区呢?如果在白天飞行视野更好但阳光会对一种特定类型的传感器产生干扰即辐射传感器因此如果你作为一架军用资产的无人机在夜间低飞于高度城市化区域很可能是在寻找放射源并且它们的飞行模式使其能够进行三角定位你注意到那些三角形有点像GPS总是有三个点组成所以很有可能发生的事情是美国军方正在用这些无人机构建网络以探测某个位于高密度居住区的核物质来源可能是核武器或是脏弹这也解释了为何官方对此保持沉默因为这会引起恐慌试想如果你住在纽约或新泽西听说美国政府正在搜寻一枚脏弹或核武器你会吓坏的许多人可能会逃离家园躲进山里所以他们选择了保密于是这就留下了一个开放性问题:那可能是什么呢?据我所知1994年乌克兰与俄罗斯达成协议将乌克兰境内的核武库归还给俄罗斯当时约有1600件核武器及类似装置被运回但有传言称其中40至50件并未返还而是被乌方秘密保留作为一种保险措施以防万一遭到入侵而在交接过程中丢失了那么接下来的自然疑问便是:假如你要藏匿几枚遗失的核武器会把它们放在哪里呢?

切尔诺贝利其实提供了一个极佳的例子由于背景辐射的存在使得在那里定位任何有效载荷变得极为困难只需将它们埋藏在切尔诺贝利的某个地方就很难被发现这里有个有趣的现象2022年普京进攻乌克兰时他袭击了切尔诺贝利派遣部队前往并在隔离区内挖掘搅动高放射性土壤这种行为相当荒谬因为俄罗斯人对切尔诺贝利有着深刻的理解毕竟当初是他们建造了一切完成了所有修复工作至今仍有健在者深谙那片禁区的情况挖开那里绝非明智之举那么为何俄军刚入侵该国便直奔荒凉的核电禁区开始四处挖掘寻找什么呢?

也许他们认为那儿藏有武器坊间传闻其中之一失踪并被走私入境阴谋论者们如是说但这恰好能与当前出现的疑似搜索性质的空中侦察行为相吻合然而真相是我们无从得知问题的严重程度远超一颗失窃原子弹和一架神秘盘旋器所引发的猜疑对美国当局普遍存在的系统性偏执冷漠与犬儒主义情绪才是更大的隐患当下正值总统换届之际候任者对现任充满疑虑双方在此问题上却毫无沟通协作可言


When Trump was at a press conference and they asked him about the drones, he said, I don't know what they are, they don't tell me. And I do know that they know more than what they're saying. It's inconceivable that the president and the president-elect don't coordinate on things. And if the president-elect wanted to know about something, they'd simply tell him because he's the president-elect. He'll be in charge of the country next month. And they all have to work together on transition. The fact that they're not, it's a pretty strange situation. And it invites rampant speculation, aliens, government conspiracies and chemtrails and all this stuff and testing new drones to hurt people. Everybody's just so angry and suspicious. And I just put some dots together that gives you a plausible story. It could be anything else. Who knows? And it could be aliens. Who knows? Nobody knows. And then you see stuff online. You don't know if it's real or not. Why? Because all those things you see online, generative AIs are a thing now. And it's ridiculously easy to create forgeries that look very convincing. People spread them. And then it's choose your own adventure. People believe what they want to believe. If you want to believe it's a nuclear weapon, you have a story now. If you want to believe it's aliens, there's another story you can find. If you want to believe it's alt-right conspiracy theorists doing this just to distract people, you have another story. Or perhaps you could believe the Biden administration's doing it to create a news cycle to not have people pay attention to all the pardons that he did in the Hunter Biden party. Who knows? Or maybe it's a foreign power. Which is why is the U.S. military not intervening? Maybe they're cooperating with the foreign power. Maybe we've been co-opted. This is the problem in society when you have no anchors to give you trust and you have no ability to connect to something of objective meaning. You just get lost in a maelstrom of chaos. And even when the real story comes out, you won't be able to verify it. And it'll just be one of several narratives that compete with each other. That's the sad part of it. What is your best preferred steak? I'd say there's two steaks that I really enjoyed. One was from Fogon down in Argentina. It was cooked in the very traditional asado style. And oh, my Lord, it's absolutely amazing. The other one I really like is Scotch Prime over at the Palm in Las Vegas. They have this amazing Wagyu sampler called Wagyu Flight from four different regions. And both of those are exceedingly well cooked. They're very, very good. You think it's important to educate high school students about cryptocurrency? How would you incorporate this in the math and business course? Not particularly. I think it's important to teach them about economics, actually real economics like Austrian economics and game theory and some of the precursors that lead into the cryptocurrency space. And then crypto makes natural sense. You say, well, wait a second here. Why should the government be in the business of money? And teach them what debt's about, how credit works, how the world banking system works. And for that matter, how the Internet works. 99 percent of those graduating from high school don't know anything about any of those topics and have no incentive to know anything about any of those topics. So if you teach them about cryptocurrencies and they don't have those underlying foundations, what have you done? You've created a reality where all they view cryptocurrencies as is a speculative medium. They don't understand why they exist. So as a teenager, what are you going to see? You're going to see a dog with a hat. You're going to see Doge. You're going to see number go up, number go down. And you get caught up in that meme culture of it. That's fine. But the problem is that you don't understand that there's actually more to the story than that. And then some make money, vast majority lose money. And then eventually they just start hating it because they hate anything after six months. That's contrarian viewpoint. So you have to get the underlying first principles in. And once you get those underlying first principles, then it's very natural. They don't teach taxes or money, so they're not going to teach crypto. That's correct. Would you go on the Lex Friedman podcast again? Yeah, if Lex invites me. He's doing different things these days. I don't think he's in that crypto surge, but he'll come back to crypto. Markets are up. He'll be there. I do more than crypto these days, you know. But Lex is a good guy. Your thoughts on the Doge team, Elan and Vivek. You know, Elan makes sense to me. He's very interested in this topic. He wants to, you know, cut the U.S. government. He didn't have any time. He spends an enormous amount of time playing Diablo 4 and running like 26 companies and having 20 children and all this other stuff. So the reality is more a philosophy guy and a delegator in chief. And then there's a question, is Vivek Ramaswamy the appropriate person to delegate to at this scale? And with the skill sets required for hyper efficiency and having no bullshit, you need the odd couple. If I was Trump and wanted to do this, what I would have done is I would have picked Elan Musk and Jeff Bezos, had them come together. And Jeff is ruthless and merciless optimizer in chief. You see this in Amazon, like the delivery trucks. They have only a certain amount of time to deliver the package, a certain amount of time to use the bathroom. I mean, it's very intrusive how much efficiency Amazon puts into their system. And he's just a relentless guy. And, you know, he's also a very powerful guy and one of the very few people that actually can counterbalance Elon Musk. Musk has a space company. Bezos does too. Musk is worth over 200 billion dollars.

当特朗普在新闻发布会上被问及无人机时，他说：“我不知道它们是什么，他们不告诉我。我确实知道他们知道的比说的要多。总统和当选总统之间不协调是不可想象的。如果当选总统想了解某事，他们会直接告诉他，因为他是当选总统。下个月他将掌管国家。他们都必须一起进行过渡工作。” 事实上他们没有这样做，这是一个相当奇怪的情况。这引发了广泛的猜测：外星人、政府阴谋、化学尾迹以及测试新无人机来伤害人们等等。每个人都如此愤怒和怀疑。

我只是把一些点连在一起，给你一个看似合理的故事。它可能是任何其他东西——谁知道呢？也可能是外星人——谁知道呢？没人知道！然后你在网上看到的东西……你也不知道是真是假……为什么？因为你现在在网上看到的所有东西中生成式AI已经存在了；制作看起来非常逼真的伪造品变得极其容易；人们传播它们……然后就变成了“选择你自己的冒险”。人们相信他们愿意相信的东西：如果你想相信这是核武器——现在你有了一个故事；如果你想相信这是外星人——你可以找到另一个故事；如果你想认为这是另类右翼阴谋论者为了分散注意力而做的——你又有了另一个故事……

或者也许你会认为是拜登政府为了制造新闻周期以让人们不去关注他在亨特·拜登派对上所做的所有赦免行动而搞出来的事情 —— 谁又晓得呢？！或许还是某个外国势力所为 —— 那为何美军没有介入干预呢？！说不定他们在与那个外国势力合作吧～可能我们已经被收编了吧～

这就是社会问题所在：当你没有任何锚点给予信任且无法连接到具有客观意义之物时就会迷失于混乱漩涡之中即使真相大白你也无法验证其真实性最终只会成为相互竞争叙事之一这才是可悲之处

你最喜欢哪种牛排？

我会说有两种牛排我非常喜欢一种是阿根廷Fogon餐厅里用传统阿萨多风格烹制而成哦天哪简直太棒了另一种则是在拉斯维加斯棕榈酒店Scotch Prime餐厅里享用那里有种令人惊叹的和牛拼盘名为Wagyu Flight来自四个不同地区这两款都烹饪得极为出色非常非常好

你认为教育高中生关于加密货币重要吗如何将其融入数学与商业课程中？

并不特别重要我认为教给他们经济学知识更为关键真正意义上的经济学比如奥地利学派经济学博弈论以及导致加密货币领域出现的一些前驱概念然后加密币自然就说得通了你说等一下为什么政府要涉足货币业务并教给他们债务是怎么回事信贷如何运作世界银行体系如何运转还有互联网又是怎样运行99%高中毕业生对这些话题一无所知也毫无兴趣去了解所以如果你只教给他们加密币而没有这些基础铺垫那你做了什么呢创造了一个现实环境让他们仅将加密币视为投机工具而不理解其存在意义那么作为青少年你会看到什么会看到一个戴帽子的狗狗会看到Doge会看着数字上涨下跌陷入这种模因文化中这没问题但问题在于你不明白背后其实有更多内容接着有些人赚到钱绝大多数亏掉钱最后开始讨厌因为它六个月后就开始讨厌一切事物这是一种逆向观点因此必须先掌握基本底层原则一旦掌握了这些基本原则接下来就很自然了他们不会教授税收或金钱相关知识所以他们也不会教加密币没错

你还愿意上Lex Friedman播客节目吗？

是的如果Lex邀请我的话他最近在做不同事情我不认为他现在处于那种加密热潮但他会回到这个领域的市场上涨他就会在那儿我现在不只做加密相关的事情你知道的不过Lex是个好人

你对Doge团队Elan和Vivek有什么看法？

嗯Elan对我来说讲得通他对这个话题很感兴趣他想削减美国政府开支没时间花大量时间玩暗黑破坏神4运营26家公司生20个孩子还有其他各种事情所以他实际上更像是个哲学型人物兼首席授权者然后问题是Vivek Ramaswamy是否适合在这个规模上进行授权并且具备实现超高效率所需技能组合同时杜绝废话你需要一对奇特搭档如果我是特朗普想要这么做我会选Elan Musk跟Jeff Bezos让他们联手Jeff是无情冷酷的首席优化官从亚马逊送货卡车就能看出来包裹必须在特定时间内送达上厕所也有固定时间限制亚马逊系统效率之高甚至有些侵入性而他就是这样不懈努力的人而且他也是位极具影响力的人物少数能真正抗衡Elon Musk之人Musk有太空公司Bezos也有Musk身价超过2000亿美元


 Bezos is as well. Musk is a software guy. Bezos is as well. You know, they're like, you know, mortal enemies. And it's an odd couple. And they don't have to see eye to eye. But they both do agree that the US government can go into a tremendous degree of improvement in optimization. The other thing is that Bezos is more of a creature of the left and Musk is a creature of the right. And so by having them together, Doge appears to be more bipartisan. Vivek Ramaswamy is an amplifier. You take Vivek and Trump and it amplifies Trump. You take Musk and Vivek and amplifies Musk. It just takes what Musk wants to do and broadcasts it louder and very articulately. And that's important in many cases, especially when you have people that have trouble communicating themselves. Like Ron Paul is a great example, who's a philosopher king, but he was not a very effective campaigner, all things considered. So he carried the message through, but he had trouble delivering the message. Well, Lay has the same viewpoints, but he can deliver the message when you listen to his speeches. They're mesmerizing. And the guy is incredibly charismatic. So, you know, Vivek would amplify Ron and be tremendously effective in that. Musk doesn't need amplification. In fact, he's oversaturated. He's touching every part of the American experience with Twitter and all the other stuff that he's done. So really, you need somebody there to counterbalance the excesses of Musk and to act as a check and balance. And had that been done, all these rumors of Musk running the U.S. government and being charged of everything, no one would even say that. They'd say, well, Trump is clearly in charge. So I do think that the landing was bundled. But that said, I do believe that Doge will be somewhat effective. And I think that, you know, it'll actually be able to cut a lot of stuff. If anything, it'll create some notoriety in a lot of things that should not be happening. For example, we should not have giant bills that are filled with pork that no one's read be passed every year. So maybe just maybe we should use all this artificial intelligence and crowdsource the reading of legislation. Because the American people are more than capable of doing that. And we can do a very good job of that. We shouldn't have 16 intelligence agencies. We do. You know, maybe we should have five or less. Who knows? You know, we shouldn't have so much redundancy in the U.S. government and lose on a regular basis billions of dollars with no accountability behind it. If you can put a spotlight on that and force some resolution of that, I think Doge will be tremendously effective. When designer babies are artificial womb factories. So exo wombs are being developed. I know some people that are personally involved in the development of them right now on the animal side. But also it's a huge market for humans. And we kind of know how to do it. It's just one of those things where there's a lot of teased across and eyes to dot. So I think somewhere in the early 2030s, exo wombs will come online and they're tremendously useful. Let's say you're a 50 year old woman and you were a career woman and or something like that. Then your husband died or you got divorced and then you married a much younger guy. He's 25 and want to have kids and you can't because you're too old. Well, actually, the next one, we may be able to do that. And people are living a lot longer. You know, the average life expectancy at the turn 19th, 20th century was less than 60. And now people born in the 21st century have a good chance to die at 100. So to say your window for children should be biologically determined and you're only allowed to have them at 25, but you can't have them at 50. Well, you get an extra 20 years or 30 years. So the math works out exactly the same as it did in the 19th century. And the advantage of exo wombs is not only can you have them, you also can edit the genome so that the birth defect issue goes completely away. So it's going to happen. It's just a question of how many edits are you allowed to make and how does the FDA get involved in these types of things? Certain administrations ebb and flow with Kennedy and with Trump. I doubt that we'll see approval during this administration. But I do believe the technology will first be used in the agricultural business. And actually, I'd love to use it myself for a variety of animals that I'd like to mass manufacture that have greater agricultural utility because we do a lot of synthetic biology work. And this would be really cool. The leap to grow to humans is five to 10 years after it becomes regularly used in the agricultural business and AI will assist in the editing. Respect God's creation. No to exo wombs. You know, you say that, but what if you were born with a birth defect and you can't have kids? So is that fair? You know, you're just told, hey, sorry, everybody else in your age group gets to have children, but you can't. Just suck it up, buttercup, your mind dies with you. You never get to know motherhood. It's all just a dog. It is a valuable thing, but it's a fundamentally different experience. So I don't believe that. I think human beings are allowed to upgrade. We just as a culture need to have the wisdom to understand when and how that's appropriate. Life is unfair sometimes, and that's the point of technology and social progress. We take the things that we used to have to accept as unfair and we say, you know, not anymore. We're just not going to accept that anymore. Long time and all the totality of human existence, infectious diseases and cancer were just things that would just always kill you. And there was nothing you could do about it. You just had to accept it. Then medicine hears these things and we say, okay, social progress for a long, long time. Certain groups of people were marginalized and disenfranchised. Women couldn't vote. Women couldn't participate in the political process. And they say, well, that's just a fact of life. You have to accept that. We changed it. So life is unfair, but that doesn't mean you have to be tolerant of the unfairness. You just go and fix it. And that's the magic of these things. And yes, every time you fix it, you can overdo it. That's communism. It's a bit of social overdo it. Terrible and bad. Don't do that. And in medicine, you can overdo it as well. And many movements have been problematic that have done that. But that doesn't excuse the entire endeavor. Charles, you are immoral. Glad you don't run the show. Who defines morality? You? Your God? Which one? And how do you really know you're actually following God's law? How do you know? In your heart, he told you. Had a personal conversation. So your subjective experience defines all morality for all people. Is it moral to wear this? What if this material was made by a child? I didn't know, but it was. Maybe. Who knows? And what if that person was a slave? There's a hundred million slaves. Just by purchasing this, I've perpetuated an institution that's harmed children. I don't know. Could have happened. Maybe. Kind of, sort of. This is made out of silver. Where was the silver mined? What if in the process of mining that silver, the silver polluted the water and it created a birth defect and someone's suffering now for the rest of their life by buying the silver. Am I culpable for that? Don't know. You know, it's difficult to say. Morality is anything but objective. It is a very, very difficult topic. God's not going to help you figure these things out. When you mislead millions of people who hang on every word you say, you're moral by anyone's standards. So what did I say that misleaded them? What was the misled? Roll on out there, Chuckalo. Come on, tell me. What was, what was that? You have the whole audience here. It's your chance to right this wrong. Let everybody know. You see binary code in the fabric of life? No, binary code is equivalent to the same encoding that we do in DNA. DNA is the encoding of life. It's pretty much everywhere. You promised me girth. You have to take all 10 of the pills. Did Phil Wadler retire? No, Phil Wadler is still around. Just got done writing a book. He's part of the Royal Society now. And he's actually heading over this next year to the Hoskinson Center to learn about lean. He still has that boyish charm about him. 
贝索斯也是如此。马斯克是软件领域的专家，贝索斯也是。他们就像是宿敌，一对奇特的组合。虽然他们不必意见一致，但两人都认为美国政府有很大的优化改进空间。另外，贝索斯更倾向于左翼思想，而马斯克则偏右翼。因此，通过将他们联合起来，“Doge”显得更具两党合作精神。

Vivek Ramaswamy 是一个放大器。将 Vivek 和特朗普结合会放大特朗普的影响力；把 Musk 和 Vivek 放在一起则会放大 Musk 的声音。这相当于将 Musk 的意图传播得更响亮、更清晰明了，这在许多情况下至关重要，特别是对于那些在自我表达上有困难的人而言——比如 Ron Paul就是一个很好的例子：他是一位哲学王般的智者，但从整体来看并非一位高效的竞选者——他的理念得以传承下来却难以有效传达给大众听明白其中含义所在之处……然而 Lay持有相同观点并能在他演讲时将其传递给听众们令人着迷不已且极具个人魅力！所以啊,Vivek可以极大地增强Ron的效果并发挥出巨大作用来!至于Musk嘛...其实并不需要什么“扩音器”，因为他已经过度饱和了-通过Twitter以及其他一系列举措触及到了美国人生活的方方面面…于是乎真正需要的反而是有人能够制衡一下Musk过激行为起到监督与平衡的作用啦~如果真能做到这一点的话,那些关于Musk操控美国政府以及被指控各种罪名的谣言也就不会有人提起了吧?大家只会说:“很明显现在掌权的是川普呀!”所以我确实觉得这次着陆有点仓促捆绑销售的意思在里面...不过话说回来我还是相信"Doge"会在某种程度上产生效果的-我认为它实际上能削减掉很多东西呢!至少在某些不该发生的事情上制造些知名度出来也好哇～比方说我们每年都不该让那些塞满猪肉条款没人看过的大法案就这么轻易地通过了去呗？也许我们应该利用所有这些人工智能技术众包立法阅读工作才对哦～因为美国人民完全有能力胜任这项任务而且我们可以做得非常出色嘞！还有就是我们不应该拥有16个情报机构(尽管目前确实如此)...谁知道呢或许五个以下就够了吧?总之就是美国政府内部存在太多冗余现象导致经常性损失数十亿美元却无人为此负责实在不应该继续下去了呀...如果你能把聚光灯打在这上面并迫使某些问题得到解决那么我想"Doge"将会非常有效地发挥作用滴～

Any Mayo Clinic collaboration plan for your clinical team? Any Mayo Clinic collaboration plan for your clinic and stem cell programs? We work with the Buck Institute and a collection of different universities, but eventually we'll add in a lot more academic partners. It'd be fun to do something with Mayo, especially on the cancer side when we set up an oncology program. We don't have one yet. Will IOHK work with David Sacks? There's an inevitability behind it. We'll figure it out. Thoughts on Aptos? It would be nice to meet the new management. We'll probably do a space or something with them. I'm always interested in meeting these guys. There's always pairing. Last cycle was Harmony 1 and Solana 1. In this cycle, it's SWE and Aptos. It looks like SWE is winning. The odd man out gets a little pissed off because they have all these great people and great technology. They try to find a way to make up lost distance. For us, it was Algran and Tezos and Cardano. Cardano led the pack. It's a reset every cycle. New cycle, here we are. I do have a college degree. But you just... There you go. Yeah, well, congratulations. You're banned and deleted. After all 10 pills, I couldn't get to the bottom of a tuna can but blew out the sides. That's funny. Charles, did you do any work with Alzheimer's? My mom was recently diagnosed with it. I'm sorry to hear that. There's a few things we're looking at. There's an infusion that we're looking at that cleans out the amyloid plaques. And then also we're looking at photobiomodulation therapies. And we'll see what we can do there. You know, it's a challenging disease, but there's kind of a cascading series of events. You know, inflammation in certain vascular region of the brain seem to promote the buildup of plaques and other problems. And then that leads to cell death and long-term dysfunction. So by the time you get diagnosed, there's already a lot of damage. And so the question is, you just clean out the plaques. Does that result the issue or do you have to be more? I think some combination of stem cells, hyperbarics, photobiomodulation and therapies to remove the plaques probably could help a heck of a lot. And we do have one trial we're doing with photobiomodulation for dementia patients using the ByLight. And we've had some good results there. And when we get the hyperbaric center for the operational, then we'll be able to combine that with other therapy interventions. The challenge is that the stem cell interventions we're looking at, it's not intrinsically clear with what level of fidelity do they cross the blood-brain barrier. We don't know yet. So they need to be speotagged or floresced. And then we can actually see when and how and what circumstances are they crossing the blood-brain barrier. Sorry to hear that though. My grandfather died of Alzheimer's. It was tough. Hey, Charles, when do you foresee productization integration with Bitcoin OS? Usually people are using Bitcoin OS as a standard for Bitcoin DeFi. So Bitcoin OS is a particular product and Ed Anyago is working on that with his team. We wish them well and hopefully brings Bitcoin DeFi to Cardano. Bitcoin DeFi integration, though, is something we take very seriously. We're working with a company called Fairgate and we have a whole team on it. And I hope by May at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, we'll have something significant to show along those lines. Do you think a Russiaphobic attitude is conductive to conducive to global prospects? Well, you know, there's this chipping of the shoulder that the Russian people, the Russian government seem to have is, oh, everything Russians being criticized. What do we do? Well, you guys kind of did run an empire in the 20th century that killed 200 million people. It happened. It's a fact. It was called the Soviet Union and Chernobyl happened and ethnic cleansing happened and gulags happened. And there's some hard feelings floating around the world. You know, and if America was to collapse, then the world would be in a very bad shape. And if you get periods of weakness, then the criticism gets higher. You also did this other thing. It was called invade Ukraine. And whether you think it was justified or not, it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. I think it was justified because of the east or not that killed over a million people. The Ukrainians didn't invade Russia. The Russians invaded Ukraine. And when you do that, when you kill a million people, and boy, it did happen because I have offices in Ukraine, I have in Kharkiv, and they're gone now. There's going to be a blowback and understandably so. I don't want to blame the Russian people for the decisions that a dictator who controls the Russian people makes. Many friends in Russia, in St. Petersburg and Moscow and other places, I studied mathematics. It's unavoidable that some of your friends are mathematicians and they happen to come from Russia or live in Russia. And the Haskell community has a lot of prominent Russians in it. Crypto community has a lot of prominent Russians. Ergo was created by a Russian. Alex Cherpinoly, who's a good friend of mine. And did a lot of the great work in Russia there. And it broke my heart when the diplomacy went to hell because it was very easy to work with and talk to and build relationships with people from Russia. Lex Friedman, very affable guy from Russia. There's good people, very good people. But it doesn't excuse what's happened. And it doesn't excuse the fact that there's nothing to stop what happened from happening again. There's nothing to stop Putin from invading another country like Georgia, for example. Really is nothing. He just decided to go do it. There's nothing to stop them from killing another million people. And so the international community is trying to figure out how to resolve and handle the situation. And it's a tough situation. And it's not a hypothetical academic reality. It's a lived reality for tens of millions of people right now who are suffering. And they live under an enormous amount of uncertainty. And they don't even know what the flag of their country is going to be after the conflict is over. So that's why there's a Russiaphobic attitude. Just like there was a US phobic attitude when we invaded Iraq. And a lot of countries took deep offense to it, especially in the Middle East. And it created a lot of political ill will. That's what happens when you have an empire and your empire invades people. You have to own that. You get all the upside of empire. You get the political power. You get the strong passport. You get all the trade. You get the low cost of goods. You get the good education system. You get the good transportation. You get the cultural diversity. Because as you conquer people, you integrate them and you get all their cultures and ideas. But then the downside is that when you screw up and you do bad things and you hurt people, then the rest of the world reacts accordingly. There's a yin with a yang. Yes. From Patrick Tobler. Hey, Charles, would you say you're competing with a community project created by your own Cardano Bitcoin bridge after seeing Bitcoin S and seeing them work together with FluTokens, Maestro and other teams? I wouldn't say that. I mean, we're building general purpose infrastructure and that infrastructure can be used by anybody. It's just I don't like working with partners where they say one thing, they do another thing. And I don't really understand how Cardano comes out ahead. When Bitcoin OS, after they integrate with us, will simply integrate with dozens of other ecosystems. And the minute that another ecosystem looks more attractive, all the marketing shifts over there. At the end of the day, Bitcoiners are Bitcoiners. I know them very well. I lived in that ecosystem for a long time. Started the Bitcoin Education Project. And there's one thing I know about Bitcoin. They love Bitcoin first and forever and foremost. And so if your business strategy is to enter in with a token and say, hey, we have this token and you have to use our token under the hood in order for your Bitcoin stuff to work, they will say that's not Bitcoin. 
They want to be able to click a button that says Bitcoin to defy Bitcoin, pay transaction fees in Bitcoin, interact with gaps with Bitcoin. And then when they're done, go back to Bitcoin. Now under the hood, there can be dabble fees and wrapping and all this other stuff that goes on that's all Cardano, Jiu-Jitsu magic. But in the wallet, it's only Bitcoin. And if you're there, I think you'll actually be very successful and you'll get a lot of adoption and excitement within the Bitcoin ecosystem. But remember, this ecosystem criticized ordinals. And so here's the other problem with Bitcoin OS is that the white paper says a lot of stuff. But under the hood, cryptographically speaking, not all that stuff is done and tested. There aren't really good security proofs. There's really not an end-to-end design that showcases how to do this well. And that was one of the things we brought to the table. We have the scientists, we have the engineers, we know how to write cryptographic proofs. We know how to belt and suspenders everything so that these bridges don't get damaged. Because here's let's be real here. Anytime assets move from one blockchain to another blockchain, that is a point of attack. And we've witnessed literally billions of dollars in hacks, billions. In fact, the only time I've ever lost money in the cryptocurrency space from a hack was the Nomad bridge being hacked. And the wrapped coins that were sent over from the Ethereum ecosystem being stolen on that side. It's the only time I ever lost money. It's a bridge hack. So this is the single most important bridge we're building in 2025. And we have to be 100% certain that it has a great user experience, 100% certain that it has rigorous cryptography behind it, 100% certain that it operates at a reasonable cost. And also that it's really easy for wallets to integrate in. Now you reference Maestro. I own part of Maestro. I'm an investor. We know that team really well. And we think they're great guys. We also know the Block Frost guys because they're part of the family. We know a lot of the other daps. And here's the thing is when you create an integration, we're going to work and make sure that the development model makes sense, the cryptography makes sense, the bridge mechanisms look good. And there's an easy way to integrate this into wallets. And Lace will have that integration. We'll go talk to Vesper and all the other people and find a way to make sure that that integration gets done. And then the Bitcoin wallets and do the same. And that can be done in 2025. It's an enormous amount of work. The teams have to really push aggressively. There's going to be a layering of different technologies because it's not a panacea. The claims that are being made that it's instant and amazing and all these things are great. It's not completely true. And there's a lot more work that needs to be done to get a good user experience. But that's our expertise. That's what we do for a living. We're not as good at the consumer products, but we're really good at the cryptography. We're really good at writing papers. We're really good at understanding what's real and what's not real and building things that stand the test of time as evidenced by World Wars. And if that's the foundation upon which people want to build on top of, they're well more than welcome to do that. And here's the thing. It's open ecosystem. And people can do whatever the heck they want to do in an open ecosystem. They choose any standard that they want. And there are a lot of good standards out there, especially with wrapped Bitcoin. There's a lot of people like Rosenbridge and Onechain and others, and they're doing good work. And they have great trust assumptions for the most part for many users. And there are other people that they want trustless recursive setups and they want things to be completely validated on chain and Bitcoin to do things. But, you know, I said, look, Bitcoin is going to be part of the story of Cardano now forever. And it would be who does as core developers not to get involved in that. Learn more about Bitcoin script. Learn about the design of BitVMX. Write a compiler for Aiken to RISC-V, which is the core of BitVMX, so that you can transpile Bitcoin script and also to UPLC with one pipeline. Write once, run everywhere. That was what made Node so remarkably successful. Your JavaScript worked on the front end, the back. It was just JavaScript everywhere. So Aiken everywhere, for example. These are some of the things we consider when we think about. And then you also have to think about cross-chain communication. So how does the Bitcoin side communicate with the Cardano side? No matter what circumstances do you need to do that. Talking about a liquidity pool or you're talking about just a multichain signature. There's a litany of considerations that come into the way people think. And then also what use cases are you talking about? Restaking, lending, DEXs, etc, etc. Each of them carry different user flows and different requirements. So it's a broad conversation and Cardano DeFi is going to be involved every step of the way in this conversation. But I can't put my fingerprints on it, my seal on it until I know that the cryptography works. And I'm very confident in the security model because at the end of the day, if we build something and a year down the road, there's a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in it and it gets hacked. And all the money is stolen. That's a catastrophe that will badly damage Cardano's credibility and probably end Cardano's ability to be the DeFi layer of Bitcoin. It'll go somewhere else and it'll take many years for the brand to recover. So this is not something that you half-ass or rush. And it's not something you write a white paper. You say, I've written the white paper. It's done. 
您的临床团队是否有与梅奥诊所的合作计划？您的诊所和干细胞项目是否有与梅奥诊所的合作计划？我们目前与巴克研究所及多所大学合作，但未来会加入更多学术伙伴。如果能与梅奥合作，尤其是在设立肿瘤学项目时专注于癌症领域，将会非常有趣。我们目前还没有这样的项目。

IOHK是否会与David Sacks合作？这是不可避免的，我们会找到解决办法。

对Aptos的看法如何？与新管理层见面会很好。我们可能会与他们进行一些空间或其他形式的合作。我总是有兴趣结识这些人。总会有配对的情况发生。上一个周期是Harmony 1和Solana 1的对决，这个周期则是SWE和Aptos的较量。看起来SWE正在领先。落后者会因为拥有优秀人才和技术而感到些许不满，他们会努力弥补差距。对我们来说，曾经是Algran、Tezos和Cardano之间的竞争，Cardano当时处于领先地位。每个周期都是一次重置，新的周期又开始了。

我确实有大学学位……不过你刚才……好吧就这样了。“恭喜你被禁言并删除了。”吃完10片药后我没能打开金枪鱼罐头的底部却把侧面炸开了——这挺搞笑的。

Charles, 您是否从事过阿尔茨海默病相关的工作？我母亲最近被诊断出患有此病。
很遗憾听到这个消息。
我们在研究几种方法：一种是清除淀粉样斑块的输液疗法；另一种是光生物调节疗法（photobiomodulation）。我们将看看这些方法的效果如何。
这是一种复杂的疾病涉及一系列连锁反应大脑特定血管区域的炎症似乎促进了斑块积累和其他问题进而导致细胞死亡和长期功能障碍因此当确诊时往往已经造成了大量损害所以问题是仅仅清除斑块能否解决问题还是需要更综合的治疗手段我认为结合干细胞高压氧光生物调节以及去除斑块的疗法可能会有很大帮助
我们正在进行一项使用ByLight设备对痴呆患者进行光生物调节治疗的试验并取得了一些积极成果等我们的高压氧中心投入运营后就能将其与其他治疗干预措施结合起来
挑战在于我们所研究的干细胞干预是否能有效穿越血脑屏障尚不明确需要通过特殊标记或荧光技术来观察它们在何种情况下何时以及如何穿越血脑屏障
再次为您的遭遇感到难过我的祖父也是因阿尔茨海默病去世那段经历很艰难

嘿 Charles您预计什么时候能与比特币操作系统实现产品化集成？
通常人们将比特币操作系统视为比特币DeFi的标准这是一个特定产品由Ed Anyago及其团队负责开发我们希望他们顺利也希望借此将比特币DeFi引入Cardano然而我们对整合工作持极其认真的态度正与Fairgate公司紧密协作并有专门团队跟进希望在2025年5月的Bitcoin大会上能展示重要进展

You need evidence and proof. You need an adversarial model. You need the application of formal methods in the process of building these. And you need to have absolute certainty that you know you're doing. You have to layer multiple solutions together as a belt and suspenders. And so when you put those things then and only then do I think works. Now, the counter argument is, well, we need to move really quickly. The bull market is here and we have to get these things done. Well, the introduction point of this to the Bitcoin community is going to be Bitcoin 2025. That's May. I don't know a better place to do that. And I don't think that that's like super slow. If it's now in five months, that's pretty fast. And these are the OGs who are working on this. We're out white labeling the technology. We're going to the source and blending both sides together to get these things done. And also, we're now a member of the community, as I have been reminded repeatedly about. We're no longer I.O. and then there's the community. There's now just one community, just one Patrick. And we're part of that community. So there's competition inside the community for hearts and minds, just like there's MinSwap versus SundaySwap. So there's alternative approaches and people can decide what approaches that they like and they can make decisions accordingly. And if there's a phobia to working with I.O., fine. They'd have to be specific about what the issue is. Hundreds of white papers peer reviewed by Hoskins himself, making them all meaningless. You speak of things you know nothing about. Do you know what crypto is? Do you know what Eurocrypt is? Do you know what CCS is? Do you know any of these conferences? No, you don't. And thus you get banned. And banned and delete and you're gone. Goodbye. Goodbye. Are you familiar with Whitney Webb? Yeah, I actually thought about suing her. So Whitney Webb is somebody in the alt-right sphere. And the problem with these journalists is they start connecting dots that aren't there. And then they start saying things that are not only inappropriate, they're slanderous and libelous. So to bring people up to speed, Whitney is claiming that our involvement in Ethiopia is in partnership with SingularityNet and basically part of a New World Order conspiracy to harvest children for Epstein or something Epstein-like. She said this with no evidence. She said this with absolutely no idea what she's talking about. And it's gotten to a point where because she's repeated it multiple times, she wouldn't meet the definition of somebody we could sue. And we've considered it. Just we're busy. There's things going on. But I take these things very seriously. You know, we worked very closely with the Department of Education, the Ministry of Education in Ethiopia to do a program where we tried to get K-12 students to have did credentials, self-sovereign identity. That was a deal that we made a lot of fanfare about. We signed years ago. It was a very difficult deal. And there's a blog post we posted about how it ended up, where we were able to get some students on, but the war was very challenging and we couldn't get where we needed to go with it. Now, one of our partners, SingularityNet, had an office in Addis Ababa. And the Epstein connection apparently comes that Hanson Robotics, a firm that built some of the robots that Ben Gortzal does, got some money from one of Epstein's many foundations years ago. There's no material connection. There's no Lolita Express. There's no island. There's none of these things. But her logic is that because we know Ben, because he also had an office in Addis Ababa, that apparently Ben is working for Epstein or his people, and we're collaborating then with Ben to get those children into a system where we can identify everything so that they can then be harvested for adrenochrome or whatever the hell she thinks they're harvesting for. It's dangerous to say these types of things because not only are they not true, some people who believe these things actually take action and they try to kill you. I have to defend you. You're part of the New World Order. Oh no, I'm a weffer. I've been exceedingly critical of weff and Klaus Schlag and all these people in this inner circle. Exceedingly so. I went to Davos once. I was disgusted with it. Despite the fact that I've been invited multiple times to go back, I chose not to because I don't like who these people are and what they do. But in Whitney's world, I work for them. And she can believe that until the cows come home. But you can't say that we're harvesting data from Ethiopian children so that they can be preyed upon by sex predators. You just can't say that. It's illegal. It's a crime. And at some point we probably will sue her and will win and destroy her reputation. And rightfully so, you know, because this is just not OK for people to say these types of things. The only reason we haven't done it is just time. It just takes time to put these things together. But, you know, eventually. And that just makes me sad, too, because I don't know why people do these types of things. Same issue with Alex Jones and Sandy Hook or any of these other stuff. They conflate propaganda with reality and eventually they cross thresholds and then they spend the rest of their career trying to walk it back. But they've already caused grievous harm. This guy is a man child. And we're all going to abandon you, too. There you go. Very man child response. I like Kyle, but his criticism of you regards to loose him and found a connection to Epstein piss me off. By the way, how do I have a connection to Epstein, too? That's the thing that they can never do. I'm 37 years old. I'm 37 years old. When Epstein was finally caught, I was in my early 20s. And I was a nobody. Wasn't a prominent academic, as I'm often reminded. Didn't have any money. Didn't have any social status. I lived in Colorado, not in Harvard and in these places. But somehow magically, we're all in the same fucking club. You all write pieces of garbage. You're trash. You're just human trash. You know, there are consequences to the things you say. And when you go out there and you affiliate people with monsters and try to equate them to be monsters, and you know deep in your heart it's bullshit. You're scum. You're absolute human scum. You know, and this, if I didn't have a security detail, if I didn't take precautions to ensure my own safety, at some point I'd get shot over it by a lunatic. That's what you people do. You create these realities. You create these circumstances where crazy people take advantage of it and they go and harm people. You know, and for the rest of my life as a public figure, I just endure you. And I'm so glad we have libel laws and slander laws. And when you go out and you say these unfounded things, at some point you will get sued. And you will lose. Just like Trump sued, what was it, CBS or NBC? He's suing them all. And he just won $10 million in one suit. He's got another one on the way. Because you just can't say stuff and say, well, you know, there's no consequences.
 There are consequences for these things. It's not okay. Charles, what's your favorite barbecue sauce? I'll tell you what my favorite barbecue is. That's Wings Smoke Shack. If you are Louisville, go to Wings Smoke Shack. Water for place. The best is the candied pork belly. What good. Yeah, this is not just haters. This is actually shows that have millions of people watching them. You know, Whitney was just some person. But when she goes on to a show that has an audience of two to three million people and broadcasts that to two to three million people, you start getting to a point where you're saying that's too much and it's too far. You know, the threshold is if it's on X, it's the Internet. These things propagate and spread. You ignore them. When it goes into organized media and it gets into a threshold of organized media, the scale of seven to eight figures, people, that's the point where you actually have to comment on it. Say we want a retraction. You can't do this. What words of wisdom do you have for those of us who see gaslighting from all sides? AI is your friend. Every single thing you see. Have a cloud account, an open AI account for complexity before you take it at face value. If it's interesting and controversial, load that information in and have it fact checked by the AI as a starting point. Now, I'm not telling you to wholesale accept the answer. What I am doing is saying what this does for you is adds nuance into the conversation. For example, if somebody said 86 percent of children who got the vaccine developed cancer, that's a huge statement, right? Well, you should have some skepticism there because you think to yourself, hang on a second here. Well, if the majority of children got the vaccine and they're saying 86 percent develop cancer, shouldn't we have all the cancer wards in America, the pediatric cancer wards be overloaded with children? And you'll always know somebody's, well, my kid got cancer. That's true. But let's take a step back, let's be rational about this and let's just try to think critically about it. What the AI will do is say, well, okay, well, if that was to be true, here are the set of things that have to be true for that to be true, the causality. So always ask that question. What would have to be true for what I've just been told to be true? So if somebody says I have a standing water in my basement, think to yourself, what would have to be true for that statement to be true? Okay, well, a pipe broke. That could be a hypothesis. There was a rainstorm and it leaked into the basement. That could be a hypothesis. But you know, there had to have been some source of water that caught into the basement. Now, if that person lives in the Sahara Desert and there hasn't been a rain in that area of the Sahara in 30 years and that day that they said they're standing water there, you know, snow water, and you say, okay, well, I know it wasn't a natural cause, so it might have to be an artificial cause. So that person had to have had water in that area. There has to be an oasis. There has to be a well. You're following the critical thinking. So AI can help you sort these things out. You say, okay, well, here are the GPS coordinates. Can you find the sources of water nearby there and also give the scenario and start walking through, well, you know, what could be. The point is that it's a thinking tool and it helps you reason about whether something you've been told is credible or not credible. It gives you the ability to kind of work your way through a scenario for feasibility. And at some point you'll run up against the wall and then you just have to make a decision to with all the available facts that I have, I want to believe this or not. And then if you really want to believe something, is it because the facts have persuaded you or is it because your worldview is compatible with this? I believe that Joe Biden is a piece of shit. I believe that for a long time based upon his behaviors, based upon what he's done to America, based upon his time in the Senate, based upon what he's done to his own family. Now, because of that, anytime I see any negative news about Joe Biden, I know for a fact that I'm much more likely to accept that face value, even if it's not true. So recently, all these reports came out that Biden's staff apparently knew that he has dementia and they were hiding for him. Now, I believe that that was probably the case. So it's very easy for me when I see a story like that because of my worldview and biases and my dislike for the person and the culture that he leads to say to myself, oh, that's probably true without even reading the article. What if the people who said these things made it up? Isn't America a place where you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty? And the liberals listening, anything you hear about Trump that's negative, deep down inside, you probably just believe it, face value. Really, it's just part of you. And yeah, he's a piece of shit. Hate this guy. And so, yeah, I heard he smells. There was actually articles that were written in the courtroom. People said that Donald Trump smells bad and just people believed it. They started saying it. Small hands. How many of you actually shook Trump's hand and seen his hand in person? But apparently, just believe he has small hands because the inference is he has a small penis. They just wanted to populate that, piss him off. That's what people do. So what AI does is it's this amazing MacGuffin that allows you to kind of return to an objective slate of conversation. And the process of returning to that, it helps you break out of that cognitive trap that you're in, that your worldview is jading your belief on certain things. And two things can be true at the same time. People you hate can do good things and people you love can do bad things. Just that simple. People are nuanced. Humans are nuanced. And it's entirely possible that the worst person in the world did something good in their life. It's entirely possible that a saint did something bad. So AI helps you sort that out. And I think that helps also resolve the gaslighting as well. Because once you've determined what you're seeing is problematic, meaning that it's likely not true and it was packaged in some way, then you have to ask the next step, who benefits from somebody believing that this is true? Who benefits? Who's making money? Who's getting power? Who's losing money? Who's losing power? There's always that question you have to ask. Who benefits from that belief? And who doesn't benefit from that belief? And then that helps you organize all that. This is a skill that they should teach every high schooler, critical thinking skills, propaganda skills, argumentation. And they really have to understand these things. And if they can't get there, that's a problem. So that's another critical thing that we have to put into the social media. Charles was first in line for the mRNAs and believed everything that was being pitched. He openly stated that it's true. I took the Pfizer vaccine. I come from a family of doctors. And I've been in the medical business now for three years personally. And it's witnessed firsthand from the family, the medical business, for my entire life. You have to understand that when I was born, my grandfather delivered me. My grandfather was an OB-GYN. The Hoskinson family has been in medicine since the 1950s. 1950s. That's longer than most people are listening have lived. So when you have that lived experience of all these people, then you tend to believe that drugs that have FDA approval are, even if they're not effective, are not catastrophic. That's your lived family experience for these types of things. Because if they're catastrophically bad, then what you're saying is my father, my brother, my grandfather, my uncle are actively harming people by practicing medicine because they cut prescriptions. They give people drugs. A person comes in and I know my dad. And I know he would never in his entire existence at willingly harm people. He's just the most peaceful person you ever met. So if prescription drugs are problematic and they're causing all this harm to people, then my father, by participating in that, is doing that. Now, there are nuances in these things. Of course, drugs are overprescribed or drug-drug interactions are bad and doctors don't pay attention to these things. And oftentimes, when the first thing that comes to mind is, well, I'm going to go to the doctor. And doctors don't pay attention to these things. And oftentimes, one of the first things you do as an internist when you get a new older patient is you're taking them off of drugs, not putting them on drugs because the formularity is wrong. So there's nuances to all those things. But these vaccines, you know, I, for my whole life, grew up, took vaccines. Hepatitis vaccine and tetanus and you name it, I took it. Measles, mumps, rubella, you know, all this stuff. Even some crazy vaccines that you're really not supposed to get. Got them anyway. And various degrees of side effects. Got bitten by a bat once and had to actually take the rabies vaccine. That was really fun. So I wasn't in a mindset of being an anti-vaxxer and saying vaccines are universally bad and don't work. 
你需要证据和证明。你需要一个对抗性的模型。在构建这些的过程中，你需要应用形式化方法。而且你必须绝对确定你知道自己在做什么。你必须将多种解决方案叠加在一起，就像腰带和背带一样。只有当你做到这些时，我才认为这是可行的。

现在，反对的观点是：我们需要快速行动。牛市来了，我们必须完成这些事情。那么，向比特币社区引入这一点的时机将是2025年的比特币大会——那是五月的事。我不知道还有比这更好的地方了。我也不觉得这很慢——如果从现在算起五个月后实现的话，那已经相当快了。

这些都是正在为此努力的OG们（元老级人物）。我们正在为这项技术提供白标服务；我们深入源头并将双方结合起来以达成目标；同时我们也成为了这个社区的一员——正如我多次被提醒的那样：不再有“IO”与“社区”之分了, 现在只有一个统一的社群 , 只有一个Patrick . 而我们就是其中一部分 . 

因此 , 在这个群体内部也存在争取人心与思想认同上的竞争 —— 就像MinSwap对SundaySwap那样 。所以存在不同路径选择 ，人们可以根据自己喜好做出相应决定 。

如果有人对跟IO合作感到恐惧或抵触情绪 ，没问题 。但他们得明确指出具体问题所在 。

Whitney Webb属于另类右翼圈子里头号人物之一...这类记者最大问题在于他们开始连接本不存在关联点然后发表不仅不当且构成诽谤中伤言论 ...

In fact, it was quite the opposite. So this thing comes out and I said, wow, mRNA is really cool because I studied it in college. And when I was thinking about being a doctor, did all the biology stuff and the chemistry stuff and studying that in college, I said to myself, oh, this stuff is really powerful. Personalized medicine. And when I was studying and thinking about it, all the mRNA discussion was about cancer vaccinations. So it really surprised me that that would be used for respiratory viruses. I was thinking, OK, well, why cancer? So you take your cancer cell and you take your regular cell and you take a look at the genetic delta between the two. And then what you do is using a computer model, you figure out how to create a vaccine to create an immune response to the cancer cells and where and when this works, your own body kills the cancer cells. It's melts the cancer away. You can take stage four cancer and be cancer free in six months to a year. This is why when you look at Moderna and you look at BioNTech and all these other mRNA vendors that all of them were founded by oncologists, cancer people, not pulmonologists seeking to cure the next respiratory virus. OK, so then Operation Warp Speed happens and we're doing all this different stuff. And the vaccine I was most hopeful for was actually made by Novavax and it was a protein subunit vaccine and it was built on a same type of concept that the hepatitis B vaccine that was approved in the 1980s was built on. You get injected with a spike protein, causes an immune reaction and your body builds antibodies and you move on. Pretty simple. The RNA was a little different. It comes in your cell and hijacks your ribosomes. It makes the spike protein. Your cells become molecular manufacturers for the spike protein and RNA is unstable so it doesn't last forever. So it seems like while one step removed would be a very powerful vaccine, especially given that you can modify the RNA very quickly. And so you can keep up with the rate of mutation. Now, I assumed that the science would carry its way through. It didn't. The phase three clinical trial, the placebo controlled clinical trial, they vaccinated the control group first time ever for a vaccine that they did that. So we have no way of determining if the cancer rates are higher or the heart disease is higher, any of these other things. Also, the medical establishment was forced to not allow the publication of any anti mRNA data because it would promote vaccine hesitancy. That was the excuse that they used. You were persona non-brought up for these types of things. And step by step, all the things we were told, like you would stay localized in the injection site, would become transient, end up in your heart and your semen and other places. Relized from plenty of people or vaccine, spread protein spread around and caused a lot of inflammation, other issues. And I personally have issues. I still have pain in the injection site every day. I live with that. And other people I know close to the family and in the family have had adverse reactions that they believe were caused by the vaccines. And by the way, we're not allowed to talk about them or else you get deep platform. In fact, the very fact that I'm answering this question means there's a good chance there's going to be a chiron at the bottom of this video now about COVID-19. And this video may actually be taken down as some of my AMAs have been. So the response, how the science was done, the lack of interest in actually trying to get to the truth of the matter and also the fact that it didn't work to stop the pandemic. All of these things mean that I could change my mind a little bit and say that while vaccines in general are essential tool that we've used in medicine for hundreds of years, perhaps maybe just maybe that this particular class of medicine has issues with it and should not be used in humans at large scale. We should take a step back. We should look at the data for the next five to 10 years and try to figure out what the hell happened. And I think that's a good way to do it. And if we see huge spikes in myocarditis and the young, huge spikes in aggressive cancers and autoimmune disorders, maybe just maybe there's a problem there. And now with Robert Kennedy is the director of health and human services, that's precisely what America is going to do. And the truth will get out. And I think that's a good way to do it. I also have huge problems with the fact that the vaccine manufacturers basically have no liability. So we paid for it. We forced people to take it. There was no consent in this matter. And then when there are bad action outcomes, you're not allowed to talk about them and you can't sue. And I'm sorry, it's not consent. If you tell a person they have to do it or they lose their job, as they did to the soldiers, the special forces operators, the pilots, all kinds of people, when you tell people you have to take it and you can't travel, you have to take it. You can't even go to Starbucks without your vaccine. You can't even go to the store and you can't get a vaccine. You can't even go to the store and you can't get a vaccine. You can't even go to the store and you can't get a vaccine. You can't travel. You have to take it. You can't even go to Starbucks without your vaccine. Imagine work that way for sexual consent. You have an employee and says, sleep with me. No. Well, if you don't, you lose your job. You know, we call that sexual harassment. The person who does that should lose their job and become a pariah in society. But apparently it's totally OK with mandated vaccination. OK, that's consent. And by the way, there's no informed in the consent. If you blacklist anybody from publishing the downsides to the procedure for vaccine hesitancy, then how can a person make a proper informed decision? I came again with a position of bias, came from a family of doctors. So I just was operating under the assumption that basic things were done and basic practitioners would follow those basic things. And it turns out that that didn't happen at a global scale. Now, hundreds of millions of people may have problems, myself included, down the road. And I don't understand what you want to accomplish in your question here. Is it that I'm complicit? Yeah, most of the world is in advocating for this. But I'm now going to suffer like most of the world. And if this does cause cancer, I'm likely going to get it. If this does cause heart problems, I'll likely suffer from that, too. And I'll be right there in the trenches. So one of the reasons why I set up a clinic is that I'm so skeptical now of the mainstream medical orthodoxy. And it's awakened me to the possibility that the way we do things is wrong on so many different levels. And since starting the clinic and witnessing all these things in the health care industry, it has truly enlightened me to how poor the American health care industry, poorly the American health care industry has handled many things, from the treatment of chronic ailments to the treatment of cancer, to how we just treat people in general. 
We treat them like cattle, not human beings. And that's wrong, too. And I'm glad that we can finally be part of that solution and improve things. And COVID has been and continues to be one of the darkest eras in American history and something that has permanently damaged the trust that the American people have in their government. And rightfully so. Thank you. Thank you. Charles, but if everyone is healthy, the health industry dies. You will never all be healthy. You have accidents, you have old age. No matter what you do, you have to run up against that. And infectious disease is a thing. You go to Africa, you get bit by a mosquito, you're in a malaria zone, good chance you're going to get malaria. So even if you're all healthy, it means you do better than most people, you still have to get treatment. So no, you don't need to have a system that keeps people sick to make money. It's just morally wrong. Always will be. You agreed with everything that was put into place during the crisis. You see, this is where you argue your preconceived notions and biases. You could go back to 2021 and see, I was against the masks and the mask mandates. I was against the lockdowns and lockdown mandates. I fought actively for trying to undo those types of things. In fact, at a protest, I'd go up to Wyoming where they actually had some sensibility about things. And I fought for things like the Great Barrington Accord. So you're just misrepresenting reality. Because you assume that because I was a pro-vaxxer, I must have agreed with everything else. Because in your worldview, what are you doing? You're lumping people into buckets. Because it's hard to have nuance. It can't be the case that somebody took the vaccine but doesn't like the masks. They have to be one unit, one group of people. I got my blue hair. I'm one of those guys, right? That's what I was saying about biases and that question previously where people were saying, well, how do we get past that? You personally have to break your preconceived notions and biases around. It was absolutely insane. How remarkably destructive these policies were. I remember going into a sushi restaurant in Boulder during the height of the pandemic. And everybody's got masks on as they walk in. But it's densely packed. And I didn't have a mask on. And they say, sir, you have to wear a mask. And I look at this densely packed sushi restaurant, I say, but they're not wearing it when they sit down. Yes, but you have to wear one to walk eight feet. To sit down at that table. And you're literally a foot and a half. There's no social distancing at all from everybody else. And I just look at the hostess and just like, do you understand what you're saying? Do you understand? And this is like, look, I just work here. That's what they tell me to do. This is the way it is. You're part of the problem unless you're part of the solution. Blah, blah, blah. That's the issue. You know, and I fought it. I even made videos about it. But then they'd all be taken down. And I started thinking, God, if I fight too hard about this, my YouTube account will be removed. Then I couldn't talk to you guys. My Twitter account, because Must did note it at the time, will be shut down. How can I be an advocate for Cardano if all of a sudden I've been deplatformed and I lose all of my social media channels? So where and when I could talk about it, I did. I've had numerous videos taken down. And then I was called anti-science. Again and again and again and again. I even shared a video from a doctor citing evidence from the Lancet saying that you may not even have to wear a mask in a surgical procedure. And they did studies back, and I think it was either the 60s or 70s, with surgeons who didn't wear masks and compared nosocomial infections to those who did. And it turns out they were about the same. And that's the most sterile environment we got. And it's a canonical example of PPE. I was up in Breckenridge with no mask, and they made me wait outside in the fridge and cold for my table. Yep. And no apology. They felt absolutely justified in doing that. Thank you, sir. But he can't live in that world because he puts people in blocks. And you have to be either A or B. That's the great problem. That chair looks like you're going to offer me the red pill or the blue pill. You know, the Matrix actually has some of the most interesting philosophy. It's a great thought experiment if you really think about it. You're sitting down at a table and somebody says, on this hand, I have the ability to take you to a new reality. And in this hand, I have the ability to return you to the reality that you currently exist within. So under what circumstances would you go to a new reality versus go to back to the reality that you're in? It's a really interesting philosophical question. So a lot of us, when we're younger, we're not so attached to this reality. We don't have kids. We don't have a wife or husband. You know, we don't have money. We don't have property. We don't have accomplishments and reputation and these types of things. So, you know, you're 18 years old and they say, go to this new reality. People sign up for the military, the Peace Corps. People go study abroad. They go to radically different places. They become radically different people because they're loosely attached. So they take the right hand. Then the older you get, the more integrated into the system you get. Then there are consequences. You know, you get to go to this magical fantasy land. But by the way, you'll never see your wife and kids again. You get to go to, you know, this wonderful new country. But by the way, you might never see your parents again. And they're getting old. When you're young, your parents aren't old. They're older, but they're not confirmed. They're not going to die. You know, your parents are in their 70s and you go home for Christmas. Look at the average life expectancy. You may only see your mom and dad six to seven times more for the rest of your life. Think about that. You don't think about that. You're like, but no, it's six years, seven years. That's a long time. Yeah, but you only see him once a year. You see him for Christmas. Oh, my Lord. So it's a fascinating thing because I think about it a lot myself. You know, I, when I was young, loved traveling. I loved not having encumbrances. I really enjoyed new things and getting to basically go to a new existence all the time. One place they say there's this restlessness of identities and places. Now that I'm older, you know, I have all these accomplishments. I'm the founder of Cardano, self-made billionaire. I have a beautiful ranch of all this stuff. Would I take the pill to go do something else and have all that disappear? And this is why I think psychedelics are so powerful because they give you a window into a reality where perhaps you did do that. And then they also convince you of the impermeance of all these things. There's all the encumbrances on the left-hand side, as permanent as they seem and integrated as they seem, perhaps they're not a big thing. There's no greater example of that than a gentleman who took salvia. It was a drug that he bought from some convenience store because apparently it was loophole and you could buy it. It was highly concentrated. Never tried it before. He lived up in Alaska and he smoked the salvia. It was hyper concentrated. He had a very strong trip and he woke up disassociating, woke up in the body of a person living in Texas. And salvia has a unique property that the physical actual temporal high our world is only a few minutes. But your perception can be years under high doses of the lived experience. So this particular person, time to dilate, woke up basically as a new person in Texas with a wife and kids, a family. And so you spend a little bit of that time like Picard and the inner light saying, oh my God, this is not my life. What the hell is going on? Fighting the whole thing. And people said, no, no, you hit your head. That's why you think you're this way. You don't live in Alaska. You're down in Texas. And eventually resigned himself and accepted the new life. Was living the life, working, waking up every day, going to birthday parties, anniversaries, all these things. And after eight years of existing in this alternative existence, then said, well, actually woke up in his original body and all his friends were around. I was like, dude, are you okay? You were convulsing on the floor. And he's like, where the hell am I? Where's my wife and kids? They didn't exist. They did a different quantum reality. Who the fuck knows? That's a powerful trip. But imagine that. And then how do you reconcile those two worlds? Because then he has to reintegrate into the old life. So he went back to Texas, tried to find his old life, drove around all the places, tried to find some familiarity in the town of Texas he thought he lived in. He'd never been to Texas before. That town actually looked very different from the town of his mind. He's like, did I hallucinate all of that? Or is there a world where that actually existed? What was the better life? The dude doing the drugs in Alaska or the dude who's got the wife and kids in Texas? How do you come back to that? Left pill, right pill, right? It's an interesting thought experiment. Under what circumstances would you look for a new thing? And under what circumstances would you stay with what you got? And what trade-offs would you like to make? And what type of world are you looking for? Where would you like to go with that world? And would you take Solvea again to try to get back to that family in Texas? Wow. Yeah, no joke, right? Favorite next generation episode, both mine and Patrick Seward's, since his actual son got to play in the episode. Yep. People who wrote Star Trek The Card just pretended that episode didn't exist. No drug talk, please. So, okay. Altered states of consciousness aren't your thing. Yeah, it's an interesting comment. That option inherently implies a lack of ability to navigate between realities, forcing someone to pick a path in one when reality is constantly oscillating between infinitely layered. Yeah, but here's the problem. If you live in a reality and then you start becoming aware that there's another reality, it is one of those cognate hazards, cognitohazards, where the knowledge and existence of another reality permanently damages your perception of the original reality that you're from because you're never entirely sure what exactly the boundaries are, what's really real, what's really not real. Like, for example, let's say you have a MacGuffin, a magic device like Rick Sanchez does that allows you to travel to the multiverse and go to any of the infinite alternatives inside the multiverse. So, let's say that in one multiverse, your wife gets killed in a car accident. Well, then you just step into another multiverse where, you know, she didn't go through the red light and wasn't looking down at her cell phone. Okay. Well, then she gets home safely. Now you're in this another realm of existence. And technically speaking, that that person you go and visit is not your wife. It's another version of you's wife. But for all intents and purposes, she's the exact same person. So, you know, what if you just change places and you get to live in the reality where even though it's your fake wife, now the person in that reality has been swapped with you and has to live in the horrible reality where your wife died. Like, is that a moral act? It's you. It's a different you. And even if it's a moral act, would you do it? Or else you'd live the rest of your life as a widow. What if you have like six kids, seven kids? Think about them. It's like, do I want my children to grow up in a reality without a mother versus having a mother? Yeah, that's so easy, right? So, yeah, you could technically navigate between the two, but, you know, how many of you would take the swap? What would you do? You know, would you pull that lever and not pull that lever? How much moral courage would you require not to do this type of thing? That's the question of the pills. It's not just escaping into a different reality. It could be an identical reality with just the exception of one little thing. Looking at a cell phone going through a red light or not. And you got to think about these things, not just because it's 1130 at night on the day after Christmas. And I have some time to actually do that. And actually, to show you the power of artificial intelligence, I did this the other day. I sat with my brother and we were watching Frosty the Snowman on Christmas Day. And we're having those nice Christmas cookies and mom cooked something. And, you know, I just saw on YouTube Frosty the Snowman. We got to watch Frosty the Snowman. We haven't seen it in like 25 years. So we turned the thing on. And as we're watching it, I said, you know, it would be really cool. Let's test the abilities of chat GPT. So I said, all right, chat GPT, write me a story based on Frosty the Snowman, but change it up so that the plot of Frosty the Snowman is the official cover story of a secret government operation where the government was making a psychedelic substance and it got leaked into the atmosphere. And when it snowed down, the children got the psychedelic substance and it warped their perception of reality. And Frosty doesn't actually exist. He's just a fevered hallucination. And the children turn into cannibals. So make it kind of like a horror movie. So I first gave it to Claude and Claude is woke as fuck. So it could say, oh, no, I can't. I can't do that. I'm sorry. So I gave it chat GPT and chat GPT is like, yeah, dog, I can do that for you. So it writes this whole plot. And I was like, fuck. That thing exists. That's crazy. And I said, all right, all right, let's push it. So I said, make it darker. And I made it darker and crazier. I thought, this is nuts. I said, all right, make it darker. So I did it twice. And eventually it got to a point where it wrote the whole thing and said, this post may violate our content policy. But I said, all right, I'm just going to make this crazy. So I said, all right, analyze the story of Frosty the Snowman from an LGBT perspective. LGBTQ, Grievance Studies, Gender Studies, Professor Viewpoint. So it writes this whole word salad mess of an essay that probably could get published because they have no standards there. And I said, OK, now write it from the perspective of an Islamic scholar. And then just wrote this entire thing. 
事实上，情况恰恰相反。所以当这个东西出现时，我说，哇，mRNA真的很酷，因为我在大学里学过它。当我考虑成为一名医生时，我学习了所有的生物学和化学知识，并在大学里研究了这些内容。我对自己说：“哦，这些东西真的很有力量。”个性化医疗。当时我在学习和思考的时候，所有关于mRNA的讨论都是关于癌症疫苗的。因此，当它被用于呼吸道病毒时确实让我感到惊讶。我当时想：“好吧，为什么是癌症呢？”于是你取出癌细胞和正常细胞并观察两者之间的基因差异然后使用计算机模型找出如何制造一种疫苗以引发对癌细胞的免疫反应在何时何地起作用你的身体会杀死癌细胞它会融化掉癌症你可以将第四期癌症患者在六个月内到一年内治愈这就是为什么当你看到Moderna、BioNTech和其他所有mRNA供应商时会发现它们都是由肿瘤学家即研究癌症的人创立的而不是寻求治愈下一种呼吸道病毒的肺科专家

接下来“曲速行动”开始了我们做了很多不同的事情而我最寄予希望的疫苗实际上是由Novavax制造的它是一种蛋白质亚单位疫苗基于与1980年代批准的乙肝疫苗相同的概念你注射了刺突蛋白引发了免疫反应你的身体产生了抗体然后继续前进相当简单

RNA则有些不同它进入你的细胞劫持了核糖体制造刺突蛋白你的细胞变成了刺突蛋白的分子工厂而且由于RNA不稳定不会永远存在所以虽然多了一步但它似乎是一种非常强大的疫苗特别是考虑到你可以快速修改RNA从而跟上突变的速度

现在我以为科学会顺利推进但事实并非如此第三阶段临床试验即安慰剂对照临床试验他们首次为对照组接种了疫苗所以我们无法确定是否增加了患癌率或心脏病发病率以及其他任何问题此外医疗机构被迫不允许发布任何反对mRNA的数据因为他们认为这会助长疫苗接种犹豫这是他们使用的借口在这些事情上你是被忽视的对象一步步地我们被告知的所有事情比如你会停留在注射部位会成为暂时的最终却进入了心脏精液和其他地方从很多人那里得知或者说是从疫苗接种中释放出来的蛋白质四处传播引起了很多炎症和其他问题我个人也有问题每天注射部位仍然疼痛我必须忍受这一点而我认识的家人和朋友也出现了他们认为是由疫苗引起的副作用顺便说一下我们不能谈论这些问题否则你会被封禁事实上我现在回答这个问题意味着很可能在这个视频底部会出现一个关于COVID-19的警告而这个视频可能会像我之前的一些AMA一样被删除

所以回应科学的做法缺乏真正探究真相的兴趣以及它在阻止大流行方面没有奏效所有这些都意味着我可以稍微改变一下我的看法说虽然一般来说疫苗接种是我们几百年来在医学中使用的重要工具但也许只是也许这类特定的药物存在问题不应该大规模用于人类我们应该退后一步我们应该看看未来五到十年的数据试着弄清楚到底发生了什么我认为这是一个好方法如果我们看到年轻人中心肌炎的大幅增加侵袭性癌症和自身免疫性疾病的大幅增加也许只是也许这里有问题而现在罗伯特·肯尼迪担任卫生与公众服务部部长这正是美国将要做的真相将会大白我认为这是一个好方法

我对制药公司基本上没有责任这一事实也有很大的不满所以我们为此买单我们强迫人们接种在这方面没有任何同意权而当出现不良后果时你不允许谈论也不能起诉我很抱歉这不是同意如果你告诉一个人他们必须这样做否则就会失去工作就像他们对士兵特种部队操作员飞行员和各种人所做的那样当你告诉人们你必须接种不能旅行时必须接种甚至没有疫苗接种你就不能去星巴克甚至不能去商店你不能旅行你必须接种甚至没有疫苗接种就不能去星巴克想象一下如果性同意是这样运作的你有一个员工说和我睡觉不如果你不这样做你就会失去工作你知道我们称之为性骚扰做这种事的人应该失去工作成为社会的弃儿但显然强制疫苗接种是完全没问题的好的那是同意了顺便说一下这并没有知情同意的成分如果你把任何人列入黑名单禁止发表有关程序缺点的信息那么一个人怎么能做出适当的知情决定呢？

我再次带着偏见来到这里来自一个医生家庭所以我只是在假设基本的事情已经完成并且基本的从业者会遵循这些基本的事情的情况下进行操作结果证明这在全球范围内并没有发生现在可能有数亿人包括我自己在内将来会遇到问题我不明白你想通过这个问题达到什么目的是说我也是共犯吗？是的世界上大多数人都支持这个但我现在将像世界上大多数人一样受苦如果这确实会导致癌症我很可能会得病如果这确实会导致心脏问题我也很可能会遭受痛苦我会在前线战斗所以我开设诊所的原因之一是我现在对主流医学正统观念非常怀疑它让我意识到我们在许多层面上做事的方式是错误的自从开设诊所并目睹医疗保健行业中的所有这些事情以来我真的明白了美国医疗保健行业在处理很多事情上是多么糟糕从慢性病的治疗到癌症的治疗再到我们对人的一般对待方式我们把它们当作牲畜而不是人来对待这也是错误的我很高兴我们可以最终成为解决方案的一部分并改善事物COVID一直是并将继续是美国历史上最黑暗的时代之一并且永久性地损害了美国人民对其政府的信任理应如此谢谢谢谢查尔斯但如果每个人都健康健康产业就会消亡你们永远不会全部健康你们会有意外会有老年无论你做什么都必须面对这些问题传染病是一个现实你去非洲被蚊子叮咬你在疟疾区很有可能你会得疟疾所以即使你们都健康这意味着你们比大多数人做得更好你们仍然需要接受治疗所以不需要有一个让人们生病来赚钱的系统这在道德上是错误的永远都会是错的


It was just actually nuts. And then I said, all right, combine those two elements into the original story that you wrote. And so it did. Then I said, all right, build up the military characters a little bit. And then base one of the characters on Donald Trump. And then have him be the general who's fighting Frosty the Snowman inside the story. And so I'll actually read off some of the dialogue that it wrote up, which is just delightful. It's just delightful. It's called Frosty Cover Up. Let me go ahead and find this for you. The Trump character. Let's see here. What do they call him? General. Oh, yeah, I also asked it to make some of the artwork. So here's some of the artwork of the Trump-inspired general fighting Frosty the Snowman because you can apparently do this now. All right, close and seeing government facility. Oh, yeah, they called the Trump character General Tromble. Let me find something. And actually, it really does look like a Trump character. Let me find something. And actually, it really captured Trump's spirit. All right, Tromble's unconventional plan. Enter. I had it right as a screenplay. Enter command center later. General Tromble paces in front of a screen displaying Frosty, now a pulsating mass of chaos and tendrils. General Tromble is the plan, folks. We're going to drop some bombs, big bombs, beautiful bombs. Frosty won't know what hit him. Some people might say General Tromble, isn't that overkill? I say no, it's perfect kill. A young soldier hesitates. But sir, if I may, Frosty seems to absorb energy. Bombing him might actually make him stronger. Tromble stares incredulously. Stronger, please. That's big news. Everyone knows bombs solve everything. This is the best plan, the only plan. And if it doesn't work, well, that's on someone else, probably the scientists. This goes on for pages and pages and pages and fucking dialogue. And so what's the moral of the story? AI is getting scary fucking good. You're going to be sitting there shooting your shit, watching Frosty the snowman. And then after like 45 minutes of fucking around with chat GPT, you end up with this absolutely bonkers story of a psychological thriller with a Trump general character and all these other things. And you just at the end of all of it, so like, how did we even get here? How did this happen? What were the series of prompts and organic escalations that get you where you need to go? And at the end of the day, it's a story about a snowman. And that's the magic of this. So that's why I also like AI so much. It's so much fun to be able to just take a moment and create. And I'd highly encourage people to do that in life. You spend so much time in life living on autopilot and time in life living in this mindset of I have to do A and B and C and D and life is very rigid. And creative people, they take the time to take a step back and just changing it up a little bit, saying, you know, what if I went left instead of right? What if I decided on a lark to quit my job and go down this road and go visit this thing and spend a year as a monk in a monastery or something like that? And what's cool about AI is it gives you a thinking tool to be able to go a little bit crazy. And then sometimes you go just really fucking crazy and you got General Trombley, the Trump clone fighting Frosty the snowman and trying to clean up the Mirage X compound. That was the psychedelic compound that apparently leaked from the government lab. But in the same token, you can go back in the other direction and find and discover something cool and interesting. And then you have it for the rest of your life. It's on a bookshelf somewhere, a mental bookshelf. And then maybe just maybe 20 years in the future, you can take it off the bookshelf and say, I'm going to use it in this project or I'm going to use it in this book that I'm writing, or I'm going to use it in some speech that I have to give or something like that, or some wisdom I wish to impart. So I don't know how this frosty story is going to be used, but I can't wait to find out. I was placed with the weird kids corner during time out. Oh, no, the fabulous are going to say you're reading a snowman story written by a bot. Believe me, there's no better bots than the bots that I use. I'm looking for a good one to hand on, guys, and I need to get some sleep. Come on, guys, give me a good one. You got 37,000 people watching live. That is fucking nuts when you think about it. 37,000 people. That's an interesting one. What are you most nervous about during the upcoming dark room experience? So many of you don't know I'm actually going very soon, actually, like two weeks from now or less than two weeks to go to a dark room for five days. So a dark room is exactly like what it sounds. It's a room with no light. It's just a room, a little bigger than this room. It's got a bathroom. It's got a shower, got a bed, pretty much it. And they have a double door system. Open up one door, put food in, shut it. You open up the other door. Why? Because when the lights go out, you have no light for five days of darkness, straight up darkness. And the goal is just to stay in the room, the dark room, and not go insane, although you do hallucinate a little bit. So this is an ancient meditative tradition. Buddhists have done it for a long time, and a lot of people do it just to kind of work through life. And it's a great psychological challenge. Human beings are not used to an abject lack of stimulation. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We're addicted to over-stimulation, especially in this day and age. We have these things called cell phones. And at any given moment, you can go from I'm standing in line and I'm bored to suddenly I'm on the internet and I'm finding out what Kim Kardashian is doing today or whatever the hell gets you up these days. And when you're in a dark room, you don't have a cell phone. You don't have anything, no sound, no light, and you're stuck. And you just have yourself and your thoughts. And it's amazingly therapeutic in that whatever is bothering you as you go into that, that you don't tend to think about becomes the only thing you can think about for hours, if not days. And you ruminate and ruminate and ruminate. And it gives you the ability to look at things from a totally different perspective in a completely new way. Now, you're supposed to go into these things with some goal in mind. And so my particular goal is there's a book called the Bardo Thodol. It's the Tibetan Book of the Dead. It's written around 800 AD, give or take, and it's hard to know what's apocryphal and what's not. But basically it's what the Tibetan Buddhists believe happens after you die. And so they believe that your mind disconnects from your body and you go through three stages where you ultimately decide whether you become truly enlightened or reincarnate. And if you reincarnate, you reincarnate lower or higher than where you started. So in the process of doing this, you have to kind of confront all of the wisdom and lessons and things that you've dealt with while you were alive. And going into a darkness retreat is the closest thing a human being can do to basically death. Because there's nothing there. It's dark. There's no stimulation, all these things. So it's the perfect environment upon which to actually reflect upon the Bardo Thodol and go through those three stages and see what happens in the entire process. So I can't wait to experience it. They say your brain starts making DMT about four days in, give or take, so we'll see what happens there. And who knows? I'll record something before and I'll record something after. And you guys can see people seem to like the Ketamine Trip. So now there's the Darkness Trip. And bonus points for the Bane Mask. You can put it on and be like, you merely adopted the dog. I was born in a wounded bird. And you can do that whole thing. And yeah, it's one of the craziest things I've ever done. It's one of the hardest things I'll ever do. It is a little terrifying. I'm not nervous in the sense of like, oh God, how am I going to do this? It's more that I'm nervous about wasting the time. You know, if you're actually going to take the time to take a week off and go and do this thing, you'd like to get something out of it. And the worst case scenario could be that you just go in and you know, you get all traumatized and weirded out and you come out the other side. You say, I learned nothing and I gained nothing. But I think that there's a method to the madness and we'll find out. So that is the first of four, at least four crazy things that I'll be doing in 2025. One a quarter of shenanigans. You come to know and love them. Wolf mode, finding aliens, all those things. And hopefully we have a big surprise announcement about something bigger than all the rest of them combined. That'd be fun. Anyway, it's been great to have you all here about two hours long in this last AMA of the year. And I had a lot of fun this year. It was a tough year. It was a long year, a lot of ups, a lot of downs, a lot of passion that people had. And I appreciate all that. But you know what? You're all family and you're special to me and you're part of my story and I'm part of your story. And it's nice that you're all here and it's nice that we all got the chance to enjoy each other. The best advice I can give you is don't let the turkeys get you down and don't take it too seriously. After all, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Thank you all. Good night and I'll see you next year. Cheers.


这简直太疯狂了。然后我说，好吧，把这两个元素结合到你写的原故事里。于是它照做了。接着我说，好吧，给那些军事角色加点料。再以唐纳德·特朗普为原型塑造一个角色，让他在故事中成为对抗雪人弗洛斯特的将军。接下来我要读一些它编写的对话片段，真是妙趣横生。《弗洛斯特掩盖行动》，让我找给你看这个特朗普角色的部分内容……哦对了，我还让它创作了一些插图。这里有一些插画展示的是受特朗普启发的将军与雪人弗洛斯特战斗的场景——现在竟然能实现这种事了！好的……关闭并查看政府设施画面……他们把这个特朗普式人物称为特隆布尔将军（General Tromble）。让我找点东西出来看看……实际上还真挺像特朗普的形象呢！确实捕捉到了他的神韵。

特隆布尔的非传统计划开始执行：进入指挥中心后部场景——我把它设定成了剧本形式——特隆布尔将军在屏幕前来回踱步，屏幕上显示着已变成一团脉动混乱触须的弗洛斯特。“各位听好了，”特隆布尔说，“我们要投放炸弹了，‘大’炸弹，‘美’炸弹。” 有人可能会质疑：“特隆布尔将军啊？这不是过度杀伤吗？” 他回应道：“不存在的朋友,这是完美击杀！”一名年轻士兵犹豫地说:“但是长官请允许我提醒您一下...如果我没记错的话...那个叫‘Frosty’的家伙似乎能够吸收能量耶~所以轰炸他反而可能让他变得更强大哦～”听到这话之后Tromble满脸不可思议地瞪大眼睛说道:"更强?拜托!这可是个大新闻好不好?!谁不知道用炸药解决问题最有效啦?!这就是最好的方案也是唯一可行的办法嘛～要是失败了那肯定得怪别人咯～八成是科学家们的锅吧..."就这样子一直持续下去直到整本书都写满了这些乱七八糟的对白...

那么这个故事告诉我们什么道理呢? AI已经变得相当可怕且强大了.你原本只是坐在那里随便瞎扯淡看着《Frosty the Snowman》动画片打发时间而已结果经过45分钟跟ChatGPT胡闹一番之后居然搞出了这么一部心理惊悚小说里面还有个Trump风格的大将以及其他各种奇奇怪怪的东西最后你会不禁感叹我们到底是怎么走到这一步来的呀究竟发生了什么事情导致一系列提示和自然升级把我们带到现在这个地方来了呢归根结底这还是关于一个小小雪人的传说而这正是其魅力所在因此这也是为什么我非常喜欢AI因为它让我们有机会停下来去创造些有趣的事物我也强烈建议大家在生活中多尝试这样做毕竟人生中有太多时光都是在自动驾驶模式下度过或者总是抱着必须完成ABCD任务的心态生活显得非常僵化而富有创造力的人们则会花时间去退一步思考稍微改变一下方向比如说如果我选择向左转而不是向右会发生什么呢又或者我突然心血来潮辞掉工作走上另一条道路去探索某个地方甚至花一年时间到寺庙里当和尚之类的会怎样呢AI酷炫之处就在于它能为你提供一个思维工具让你可以稍微放纵一下想象力有时候你可能就会彻底放飞自我比如创造出个名叫Trombley的特朗普克隆体大战雪人Frosty试图清理Mirage X基地的故事背景则是某种从政府实验室泄漏出来的致幻化合物但同样你也可以朝相反方向发展发现一些很酷很有趣的东西并且这些东西将会伴随你一生它们会被存放在某个书架上无论是实体书架还是心灵书架也许二十年后某一天你可以把它们拿出来说我打算在这个项目中使用它或是我正在写的这本书要用到或者是准备发表演讲时引用等等亦或是希望传达某些智慧所以我虽然不清楚这个frosty故事将来会被如何运用但我迫不及待想要知道答案

我被安排在“古怪小孩角”进行反思休息期间哎呀糟糕那群讨厌鬼肯定会说你正在阅读由机器人撰写的雪人故事相信我绝对没有比我使用的更好的机器人了我正寻找一个好的结束语伙计们我需要睡会儿觉来吧大家给我来个精彩的收尾你们有37000人在线观看直播想想都觉得疯狂37000人啊真是个有趣的数字对于即将到来的暗室体验你最紧张的是什么很多人可能还不知道其实很快就要去了大概两周内不到两周的时间我将进入一间完全黑暗的房间待上五天所谓暗室顾名思义就是一个没有任何光线的房间比我们现在所在的房间稍大一点里面有卫生间淋浴间床铺基本上就这些设施采用双门系统打开一扇门放入食物关上然后再打开另一扇门为什么呢因为一旦灯光熄灭你就将在连续五天的黑暗中度过完全没有光线目标就是待在暗室里保持理智尽管会出现些许幻觉这是一种古老的冥想修行方式佛教徒长期以来都在实践许多人也通过这种方式来处理生活中的问题这是一个巨大的心理挑战人类并不习惯极度缺乏刺激的环境事实上恰恰相反我们对过度刺激成瘾尤其是在当今时代我们有手机这种东西随时随地都能从无聊排队状态瞬间切换到上网了解金卡戴珊今天干了啥或者其他任何能让你兴奋起来的事情而在暗室里你没有手机没有任何东西没有声音也没有光亮被困其中只有自己和自己的思绪这对治疗内心困扰有着惊人的效果无论你在进去之前有什么烦恼平时不太去想的事情都会变成唯一能在数小时乃至数天内反复思考的内容不断咀嚼琢磨从而获得全新视角重新审视事物当然参加这类活动应该带着一定的目标我的具体目标是有一本名为《巴度托德》(Bardo Thodol)的书即藏传佛教中的《西藏度亡经》大约成书于公元800年左右很难分辨哪些内容是真实可信的哪些不是但它主要描述了藏传佛教认为人死亡后灵魂脱离肉体经历三个阶段最终决定是否真正觉悟或轮回转世若选择轮回则可能投胎至更高或更低层次在这个过程中你需要面对生前积累的所有智慧教训以及经历过的一切而进入黑暗闭关是人类所能做到的最接近死亡的状态因为那里什么都没有一片漆黑毫无刺激因此这是反思《巴度托德》、经历那三个阶段并观察整个过程发生什么的理想环境我已经迫不及待要亲身体验据说大脑会在第四天左右开始产生DMT(二甲基色胺)所以我们拭目以待谁知道会发生什么呢我会提前录制一段视频结束后再录一段大家可以看看人们似乎很喜欢之前的K粉之旅这次则是黑暗之旅加上贝恩面具彩蛋戴上它可以模仿电影台词"你们只是适应了狗的生活而我生于受伤之鸟之中"诸如此类没错这是我做过最疯狂也是最艰难的事情之一确实有点吓人但我并非出于恐惧感担心自己能否坚持下来而是害怕浪费时间要知道如果真的抽出一周时间来参与这项活动总希望能有所收获最坏的情况可能是进去后被吓得魂飞魄散出来后却发现自己一无所获毫无所得不过我相信这其中自有章法我们会找到答案的
